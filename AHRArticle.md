## The historiographic stakes of late 19th-century Caribbean history

**Major edits for this section will happen in Word. Kalani will paste back in**

At first glance, US historiography on the Spanish-Cuban-American War (1895-1898) may seem extensive. However, most of what has been written privileged the US perspective on the war, mostly focused on the moment when the United States militarily intervened in the ongoing armed conflict between Spain and Cuba, and justified their actions as a fulfillment of their moral duty to help Cubans gain their independence.[^1-1]

[^1-1]: See Louis A. Pérez Jr., Cuba in American Imagination

However, an in-depth analysis of sources from the three countries reveal that the United States government knew that they lacked casus belli to intervene in war. From 1895 to 1897, presidents Cleveland and McKinley inaction safeguarded the interests of US property owners and commercial interests in and with Cuba as they worried about retaliation from Spain. They preferred to impel Spain to reform its relationship with the island rather than have a fully independent Cuba ruled by “uncivilized” multiracial insurgents that they, a “racially superior” and “civilized” US government officials and business community, did not want to deal with. Cuban insurgents in the island, many of whom participated in Cuba’s first war of independence (1868-1878), would not accept anything less than full independence. Meanwhile, white, wealthy Cuban émigrés in the United States who feared losing their racial and economic privileges, also desired a change in Cuba’s relationship with Spain and were uneasy about the possibilities of the raceless nation project of the insurgents. But when Cuban insurgents unequivocally repudiated Spain’s offer of autonomy in December of 1897, wealthy New York Cuban émigré leaders who had kept a low profile up to that moment, took control of the ruling New York Cuban Junta that directed the war in the island from abroad. The wealthy Cuban leaders demanded that mostly reluctant insurgents in the island cooperate with the US military especially after the (internal) explosion of the USS Maine in the Bay of Havana was blamed on Spain and used as a justification for US involvement in the war. The changing circumstances, the heightened media frenzy to get the US president to finally do something about Cuba, island insurgents’ repudiation of US call for a cease fire, US Congress joint resolution to respect Cuban independence with some caveats, all paved the way for United States’ swift military landing and victory in the island in the summer of 1898 and eventual neocolonial relationship with Cuba in the twentieth century.

Many US historians working on this war focused on a portion of what had been a much longer conflict between Cuba and Spain that started in 1868. Encapsulating the event to 1898 not only iterates the claim that the United States became imperial by accident –provoked by the sinking of the USS Maine–and that, consequently, the country had to suddenly “learn” to become an empire after 1898.[^1-2] In addition, such historiographical focus contributed to the labeling of the event as the “Spanish-American War” which erases Cubans as the protagonists in their own wars of independence.[^1-3] An empire does not just “happen,” nor it becomes suddenly accepted and rallied by much of the US public at the time without an established ideological framework where those actions by the US government and military could be deemed logical and justifiable to the citizenry.[^1-4]

## How do we build empire (and histories of empire)?

How does an empire make its actions meaningful to its subjects/people/citizens? How do those values weave themselves into everyday life and in the one-on-one on-the ground interactions between imperial agents and local inhabitants? These questions have informed scholars concerned with the cultural workings of imperialism as it has become clear that language, representation and the meanings they encrypt are key cogs in the empire-building machinery.[^1-5] The use of coded hierarchical discourses in texts and visual representations play a role in justifying and naturalizing domination and, as such, informs and prepares audiences to support actions that legitimize the power of ruling or aspiring political elites or groups. Formal empires may be disappearing as political entities, but the use of operations of discourse that encrypts unequal power relationships, that justifies and normalizes dominion and the silencing of others who the narrative dismisses as powerless and of lesser importance to a purportedly superior civilization continues to this day. Yet, how can the meaning-making powers of the empire be rendered visible to the researcher when much of those coded meanings have been normalized and taken for granted? This essay tackles these issues in two parts.[^1-6] First, we will address the historical problems informing this study through an example of US war correspondents who interviewed and produced texts on a Cuban insurgent general during the Spanish-Cuban-American war; the second part addresses how the use of computational linguistic tools facilitated the identification of key topics within the contexts of the words that surrounded them in a piece of writing, which allowed us to interpret their meanings based on both its digital outputs and historical context.

## Representation, War Correspondents and Empire-Making

Paving the way for US expansionism in the nineteenth century were mass-produced consumer spectacles, dime-novels, newspapers, museums and special events geared towards European-Americans. US entrepreneurs saw much commercial potential in the white, English-speaking, Christian-protestant audiences who they catered entertainment that allowed them to imagine themselves as a homogeneous “American” imagined community.[^1-7] Spectacles like Bill Cody’s “Buffalo Bill Wild West” presented the frontier as a mythic place and its history became one where fiction and reality coexisted. For the audience, the stories of the US frontier cowboy wars against Native Americans, and the fact that Cody had participated in those wars himself as well, made those stories be recognized as authentic while making palatable “the principle that violence and savage war were the necessary instruments of American progress” and “that the bullet is the pioneer of civilization.” Indeed, the frontier narrative trope/formula became an ideological archetype and precedent for the expansionist struggle against “savages” and “regressive races” by progressive imperialists such as Theodore Roosevelt.[^1-8] Similarly, other traveling spectacles such as P.T. Barnum freak show, commodified European-American fascination with “curiosities” meaning the display of people with physical deformities, many of whom were Black or mixed-race, as primitives and animal-like which reaffirmed already-existing association between non-Western people and their non-human status.[^1-9] The 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, further built up on those ideas while showcasing “inferior others” and their alleged incapability of enacting “progress” which cemented a sense of European-American “superior” status as technological innovators, and their ability to tame “nature” (meaning the land and the native people in it) to bring a land of abundance.[^1-10]  Such mass-produced consumer spectacles, along with many others cultural manifestations of the time, became powerful vehicles through which stereotypes about other cultures and expansionism were adapted, generated, propagated and iterated.[^1-11]

Indeed, what was published and performed in shows at the time gave European-American audiences “a sense of ownership, entitlement and familiarity with respect to the distant parts of the world that were being explored, invaded, invested in, and colonized.” What was represented in many nineteenth-century publications, performances and exhibitions, helped justify expansionism and, most importantly, legitimize and make European-Americans “feel part of a planetary project.”[^1-12] In other words, cultural manifestations served, purposely or not, knowingly or unknowingly, to develop, debate and spread ideas that would give meaning to their representations. Terms that describe “others,”; tropes, metaphors, and euphemisms that would covertly justify domination over other lands and its inhabitants were developed and established through the circulation of representations via cultural manifestations. Those terms circulated because they became common currency; people would intuitively repeat them because the use of that language implied belonging to a “superior” community, all of which helped structure a collective unconscious. People living in the midst of these cultural iterations become, intentionally or not, participants of the expansionist project when in their repetition of terms and representations they contribute to normalize a hierarchical and expansionist point of view.[^1-13]

Expeditionaries, travelers, reporters, scholars have all been important historical agents of expansionism. Among all those, journalists–and we would add scholars–have been singled out for being “perhaps the most open, in that their raison d’ȇtre is to write, and so they leave records of their interpretations.”[^1-14] But more than that, journalists, especially nineteenth-century war correspondents, had the major task of instantly and constantly translating and making a foreign place and people comprehensible to an audience thirsty to know about the world outside the US mainland. They became, as Peter Hulme would have it, “agents of transculturation,” because “they passed as interpreters of Cuban culture to a US readership.” Some agents of transculturation would, vested with the authority they automatically acquire as first-hand observers, undermine and sabotage the foreign people they write about as “translation is often the means at hand to strike the blow. ”[^1-15]

For example, New York Herald reporter, George Eugene Bryson, translated an article Cuban intellectual José Martí wrote hours before being killed by the Spaniards on May 19, 1895 in Dos Ríos, Cuba. Philologist Luis Toledo Sande carefully compared what Martí wrote in Spanish and the translation Bryson published in English and found that only 63% of Martí’s text has a direct correspondence to what was published in English. The remaining 37% of the article that was silenced by the newspaper referred to Martí’s discussion about the maturity of the revolution, the national unity and democratic spirit of the insurgency, all of which were mentioned by the Cuban leader to preempt US arguments to justify that they become mediators and guarantors of peace in the conflict. In addition to cutting critical parts of the original text, others were distorted to make believe that Martí supported foreign exploitation of Cuba’s “hidden treasures.” Finally, the word “revolution” was replaced by “revolt” to undermine the true nature of the war by Cuban insurgents.[^1-16]

[^1-15]: Luis Toledo Sande, “Jose Marti… page 40…

There are other examples. In a sampling of articles that dealt with Cuba in major New York-based periodicals (The New York Times, The New York Tribune, The New York Journal, and The New York World) from 1895 to 1897, 152 (60 percent) of the 254 articles collected omitted any mention of the inhabitants of Cuba, an interesting fact especially considering that in 1898 the Untied States would claim their moral and humanitarian duty to save Cubans. Insurgents did have more presence in the newspapers—they were mentioned in 81 percent of the articles on the war—but it is telling that, to judge by the articles on their war of independence, Cubans were not featured as the main protagonists or historical actors. In most of these articles, Cuban rebels were subliminally linked to the word “black” and its war-related meanings. They were represented as disorganized bands, who were “not naturally brave,” were seditious, arsonists, guerrillas, a “dangerous mob,” ”roving bandits,” and as a threat to order because they did not follow “civilized” war conventions. Examples abound: “He found the insurgents divided into small bands. They are mostly negroes. Their arms are very poor, and their leaders utterly incapable”; “He says the insurgents are poorly organized and are travelling about in bands of from three to eight and generally disband, hide their arms and flee to the nearest village on the appearance of government soldiers.” An early article on the war brings the point across by finding suitable parallel to the insurgents in their local national context: “most of them are what in this country would be termed marauders or tramps.” As Edward Said suggestively puts it: “what counts is not what people are or think but what they can be made to be and think.”

The nature of the new journalism of the late 1890s fostered these representations of the Cuban war. The armed conflict in Cuba coincided with the emergence of a new kind of reporting where publishing was a business, and news a commodity. Telegraphy, along with railways and high-velocity presses, shortened distances and time in the dissemination of news. Use of half-tone in newsprint allowed photographic images to be printed for the first time in 1897. All this required capital, and marketing practices and labor policies were followed to make news attractive and appealing to increasingly urban and educated US readers and buyers of newspapers. A reporter, for instance, would be paid based on “space” -half column, a full column and so on- a practice that encouraged journalists to imaginatively pad stories with little concern for the truth especially if its content complied with editors wanted to publish. A sensational scoop or exclusive stories were rewarded with bonuses, a practice that prompted journalists to find news stories at any cost, and even exaggerate or fabricate ones. Newspapers such as William Randolph Hearst New York Journal or Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World both spent great resources in their competition for readership; Hearst, paid dearly for ‘stealing’ Pulitzer staff to his paper, and Pulitzer’s paid out of his personal money the great cost of the news service such as cable service and even tugs to keep his business afloat. Hence the economic imperatives of the publishing business required news that appealed in content and presentation, news that would make people pay for.

One journalistic knack at the time was to send intrepid newspapermen to find an important person abroad, deliver or gather “a message from or to the outside world,” or get exclusive interviews with enigmatic or interesting personalities. James Gordon Bennett, Jr., owner of the New York Herald, the newspaper choice of the wealthy, and a pioneer in those kinds of journalistic adventures, was the first one to send his reporters to Cuba for such mission. After a failed first attempt, Bennett, Jr., succeeded with his reporter James O’Kelly who successfully crossed into insurgent territory in Eastern Cuba to meet with the insurgent leader of Cuba’s first war of independence, Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, in 1873. From this adventure, O’Kelly published a series of articles for the Herald and, in 1874, a book entitled The Mambi-Land, or Adventures of a Herald Correspondent in Cuba.

The successes of Bennett, Jr.’s, war correspondent’s exclusive first-hand stories encouraged similar ones thereafter. Of particular interest were stories about Cuban insurgent generals—especially Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo—both respected military men whose fame dated back to Cuba’s first war of independence (1868-78) and the smaller war that General Maceo fought afterwards in 1879-**. General Maceo was an intriguing personality for the US readership; he was a mulatto whose bravery and military talent brought him to the top of the insurgency as well as indisputably wide popular respect. While some correspondents interviewed General Maceo, he did not get as much limelight in the United States as Dominican-born General Máximo Gómez, who saw value on US reporters stirring up public interest in the war in Cuba. On the one hand, General Gómez facilitated such encounters with the press as his diary attests, on the other, he was an enigmatic leader. White, born in 1836, General Gómez fought on the Spanish military in the Dominican Republic, which he left to move to Cuba once Spaniards were expelled from a politically independent Dominican Republic in 1865. He joined the Cuban insurgency when the first war of independence erupted in 10 October 1868 and, since, he raised to become one of the top military leaders. Well respected as a military strategist, General Gómez was known for waging a war with limited war equipment and trained soldiers, that is, a guerrilla war where small groups of soldiers would suddenly ambush the Spanish military, attack armed with machetes. [[He also relied on burning fields **]

General Gómez was also a disciplinarian. His (well-known) difficult temper did not admit the smallest act of treason, for which he penalized with death. All this made General Gómez the target of criticism especially among the insurgency top leadership and wealthy Cubans, who accused him of being an ‘uncivilized’ military man, a caudillo (strongmen) and a dictator. At different points of the two wars of Independence, he was falsely accused of participating in the peace agreement that ended the Ten Years War (1868-78), which did not solve the pressing issues of that first war: the abolition of slavery and political independence from Spain. During the second war (1895-1898), he was also falsely accused of not preventing José Martí’s death in 1895. In a nutshell, ‘old man’ General Gómez unconventional, non-Western military tactics were feared yet characterized as “uncivilized” at the same time that his well-known fits of temperament also provided pretext to those who did not trust him as a leader for the Cuban insurgency many times citing his status as a ‘foreigner.’

By the time the second war was under way in 1895, the strong competition for news made it imperative to send reporters to the interior of Cuba to bring ‘true accounts’ of the insurgents. Indeed, in spring of 1896, three young war correspondents in their late 20s, with a rudimentary command of the Spanish language, crossed Spanish security and got to Eastern Cuba’s countryside to interview General Gómez. The first one, Sylvester Scovel, [**] motivated by the lack of direct reporting from the island, arrived in Cuba in October of 1895. He was initially hired by the New York Herald, but moved to Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World by January of 1896. Since February of 1896, when Scovel sent his first articles to the World, the newspaper anticipated and created suspense around Scovel’s reporting. He was featured as a brave and daring correspondent one who “tells, not rumors, but what he sees,” and as one who brings “authentic news of the Cuban patriots.” The correspondent possessed great qualities as an adventurer and as a transcultural agent: “Mr. Scovel has shown that he combines all the great and high qualities of the war correspondent's devotion to duty, accuracy, graphic descriptive power, absolute courage and skill both in getting the news and in sending it through the enemy's lines to his newspaper.” His news stories were among those few whose authorship was acknowledged at the time.

The second correspondent who wrote about General Gómez was George Bronson Rea. He became a correspondent for the New York Herald after spending five years as an engineer modernizing sugar-producing machinery in US-owned plantations. On January 18, 1896, he left Havana to join General Gómez’s army, which he did for nine months. While Rea did write some news stories, it was his book Facts and Fakes About Cuba, published in 1897, what grabbed much attention, including that of Spaniards who translated “an abridged version” of it that, in reality omitted criticisms to the Spanish military. The book blames Cubans for the misinformation on the war in the United States, makes the point of showing untruthful reporting, and takes especial aim at defaming General Gómez, all of which rendered a more positive view of the Spanish side of the war. The leitmotif of the book was General Gómez’s public insult and threat of Rea for being a correspondent of a newspaper biased in favor of Spain, a situation that prompted the US journalist to reconsider his initial favorable opinion of the Cuban insurgency. Rea and Gómez’s harsh relationship contrasted with that between the General and Rea’s buddy, Scovel. Since the World correspondent joined and met the General in late 1895, they became very close friends, one that prolonged even after the war was over. Scovel was very skilled in his personal relationships and in some ways got to understand and knew how to relate to General Gómez—Rea did admit that he was unable to follow Scovel’s recommendations on dealing with the insurgent leader.

Finally, New York Journal’s correspondent Grover Flint, arrived in Cuba in March 1896 for four months to report on General Gómez. During the time Flint was in Cuba, mainly in the provinces of Santa Clara and Matanzas, he was only able to send four dispatches, sometimes illustrated with his own drawings, from the field. Yet it was his book, Marching With Gomez, published in1898, what gave Flint notoriety. Flint, however, gave attention to the atrocities committed by the Spaniards, and described General Gómez in a more positive light than Rea, even though the three of them -Flint, Rea and Scovel- many times witnessed the same skirmishes. [ck Marching..]

The news stories by Scovel and the books by Rea and Flint provide us with a unique opportunity to dig deeper into the ways these correspondents transculturally translated the situation in Cuba to US readers. What words they used to talk about General Gómez, what meanings or sentiments were attached to those words, and what does this tell us about the different representations of Cuba? To do render this visible, we will examine their narratives through the different “microscopes” or visualizations that computational tools render us in the next section.

# Grounding History in Method-Driven Approaches with MMATCH

**This section will be edited here in the markdown**

## An overview of Mixed-Method Approaches To Collaborative History (MMATCH) as one solution to the epistemological challenges of digital history

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote markdown=1>At the beginning, I could not see the beauty of it. Initially this felt like it’s in the theoretical stratosphere. The practical reality is that I can see [<strong>in the different visualizations it provides</strong>] what I’m thinking about as a scholar grounded in the trends the data gives to me, but that the interpretive methods, and the data itself, need to be curated.

- *Arlene, in conversation*

</blockquote></div>

As with many histories, we’ve rooted our epistemology–how we “know” the history of the Spanish-Cuban-American War–in the space between our own positionality, primary source close-reading, and the expertise contained in the historiographic body of secondary sources in which we situate ourselves as scholars of a particular subfield.[^2-1] The suspension of a scholar between personal interpretation, source material, and external scholarly traditions has a long-standing, if elitist, history that more recent considerations of transparent positionality have sought to correct.[^2-2] From the late-Antique paideia that marked a young man as part of the Greek-educated elite to the shared-world-view *weltanschauung* or *bildung* of the well-educated European, scholarly knowledge of the humanist bent is built on the hermeneutic ability of well-trained scholars with a common worldview and shared scholarly tradition.[^2-4] Incorporating digital methods, then, can seem like a disruptor in the worst of possible ways, a button we push that bypasses the individual scholar with analysis spit out by a computer and reproduced without question.

[^2-1]: Shopkow, The Count and the Saint, intro; VanSledright, 1998;  CITE

Most digital-history scholarship acknowledges the role of these hermeneutic traditions; the most recent of that scholarship expands the idea of methods-driven history to include digital methods as one element of the hermeneutic itself, albeit one that requires a methods section.[^2-4] We take these approaches one step further by formalizing the importance to scholarly production of interpretive dialogue–of conversation, with ourselves, our sources, and our methods–that is often informal and thus invisible. MMATCH, or Mixed-Method Approaches To Collaborative History, eschews the formality, and accompanying exclusivity of, individual hermeneutics and the received, unquestioned knowledge of data. Instead, we acknowledge the roots of our scholarship in informal conversations with colleagues in hallways and around computer screens. By marking these conversational spaces as formal sites of authorship, MMATCH both surfaces the silences we accept as part of individual authorship and emphasizes the interpretive nature of interacting with digital tools in history.

[^2-4]: Mullen and Robertson, Methods Driven History journal special issue; CHNM whitepaper methods section; CITE

MMATCH is comprised of five stages, which we will first lay out in terms broad enough to suit most mixed-method collaborative authorship teams and then more narrowly for our specific focus on the Spanish-Cuban-American War:

1. Sourcing: initial agreement on the boundaries of the primary source base and individual needs for the study.
2. Parallel interpretation: separate scholarly analysis that addresses the individual positionality and methods specialties of each person in the collaboration
3. Dialogue-based triangulation: interstitial and informal historiographic conversation that triangulates the separate methods analyses. The outcome of this stage should be a draft analysis documented clearly, either in the methods section or labeled as “in-progress” analysis in the results section.
4. Revised parallel/joint interpretation: a cyclical round of formal and informal conversation that includes individual interpretation and potential methods changes resulting from the conversation in step 3. Steps 3 and 4 may repeat several times and need not be separate, as with Step 2.
5. Formal written results

There are a number of related models that help position the MMATCH approach as building on, as well as new to, both humanities and social-science versions of the historical method. On the humanities side, which privileges the interpretation of an individual, several practices align with MMATCH. The first is Johanna Drucker’s idea of capta: data, Drucker says, is given to the researcher as a whole set of prefabricated stuff. Capta is taken, captured, from unstructured evidence and turned into structured information through humanistic interpretation.[^2-5] On the other side of the historian’s interaction with computational results is what Jo Guldi describes as “critical searching,” in which the individual historian uses in-text search in their own critical reading of search returns as a stand-in for a strand of literature focused on the critique of digital tools and their results.[^2-6] These interpretive moves privilege the individual expert, a vital position for the humanistic practice of history; at the same time, that individual interpretation can circumscribe collaborative efforts. MMATCH closes that gap by bringing the formal historiographic conversation and informal seminar discussion together in service of collaborative capta and critical interpretation of computational models.

*IMAGE CAPTION: Creswell, J. W., & Plano Clark, V. L. (2011). Choosing a mixed methods design. Designing and conducting mixed methods research, 2, 53-106. Creswell notes a 2003 article by Tashakkori and Teddlie that identifies parallel structures for triangulation between qualitative and quantitative, but in which one or the other is primary, happen in parallel, and are not iterative.*

On the social science side, the need for repeatability and validation necessitates the articulation of well-documented mixed-methods approaches that blend quantitative and qualitative approaches to research.[^2-7] MMATCH might be most closely aligned with Triangulation Design, in which qualitative and quantitative data collection and methods are done separately, often with one prioritized over the other, and then triangulated to validate and extend the results from both methods. Triangulation Design as a model for digital-history collaborations stops short of the historical method in two ways. First, it generally assumes that data for quantitative and qualitative methods will be different and that one of the methods will take priority. Historians work holistically with primary- and secondary-source collections that can be prepared differently (capta) but which are ultimately the subject of interpretation in equal measure. Second, Triangulation assumes that the articulation of a method would result in repeatable empirical results. Repeatability is based on an assumption that directly challenges the idea that historical interpretation changes as the positionality of the author changes.[^2-8]

[^2-7]: E.g. Creswell, John W., and Abbas Tashakkori. “Editorial: Developing Publishable Mixed Methods Manuscripts.” Journal of Mixed Methods Research 1, no. 2 (April 2007): 107–11. https://doi.org/10.1177/1558689806298644. The authors note that “A methodological/theoretical mixed methods manuscript improves our knowledge of how to conduct mixed methods research and/or to better understand its philosophical foundations.”

MMATCH addresses both of these by documenting the value of informal discussions that often contribute meaningfully to the development of historical scholarship but are waved away as unciteable ‘conversations’ with minimal effect on authorship. MMATCH instead positions the conference-hallway conversation and conversations like it as the primary site of both capta collection and analysis. It also builds a collaborative positionality among the specific authors of a piece of historical analysis while still offering a repeatable process (even if the results aren’t necessarily empirically repeatable). The epistemological stakes of this approach, then, are threefold:

- It offers an epistemologically sound solution to folks interested in a digital-methods approach to their research question but for whom the method is a serious barrier to entry.
- It models a fair, equitable research-collaboration practice for traditionally single-author disciplines by
	- extending the literature on individual interpretation and hermeneutics to a collaborative model based in existing historical-methods practices
	- expanding access to the world of scholarly production to anyone with a voice in these informal scholarly conversations
- It offers a model for discipline-wide development of a formal literature in historical methods, which values the development, articulation and presentation[^2-9] of new methods, the communication of those new methods to practitioners of a variety of interest in those new methods, and the centrality of collaborative hermeneutics.

By interpolating our conversations and computational text analysis in MMATCH, we’re simultaneously offering an interpretive view of historical data but also changing our interpretive lens so that we can better understand our own present-day positionality as we explore the historical perspective. These choices acknowledge our individual centers of expertise and, in encouraging a collaborative process that makes the translational leap from computational model to close-read historical analysis, hit a middle ground between the structuralism of computational analysis and the hermeneutics of post-structuralism that shape the historiographic conversation and its contributors.[^2-9] We hope ultimately that MMATCH will make it easier to facilitate the training of interdisciplinary and interspecialty historians and provide a collaborative approach to the writing of methods-driven history.[^2-10]

## MMATCH in integrating computational and close-reading histories of the Spanish-Cuban-American War

</section>
<section id="Step1" markdown=1>

### Step 1: Sourcing, periodization and corpus building

With MMATCH established as a general process that suits mixed-methods history collaborations of many kinds, we now want to turn our attention to the specifics of MMATCH in a digital-history analysis of Cuba and its people as they are represented in late 1890s war correspondence. The three reporters who anchor this study are representatives of a much larger body of public-facing journalism during the Spanish-Cuban-American War. These journalistic sources comprise a small portion of the overwhelmingly large corpus of public and private documents that shaped late-19th-century histories of, and about, Cuba. Differentiating between the individual effects of each reporter and the broader weltanschauung of US imperialist, expansionist language is made more difficult by the echoes of imperial narrative that justify the mechanisms of expansionism even today.

We thoroughly introduced our three authors–Flint, Gomez and Scovel–in our introduction, but we also discussed how the new journalistm of the late 1890s further built on the context of expansionist and hierarchial narratives. Our articulation of MMATCH helped us simultaneously identify our own positionality as subjects of US imperial discourse, produce a repeatable treatment of the expansionist language in the larger corpus, and address the weaknesses of unquestioned dependence on computational analysis as neutral and “accurate”. In other words, MMATCH offered a guided computational reading that helped us step back from the imperialist language in which we are enmeshed as US citizens and treat that same computational analysis as a source that can be interpreted alongside our primary sources. To do that, we needed both a computational-flyover view of our sources to expose the weltanschauung of imperialist language, and we needed to connect that flyover view to the act of close reading.

### Step 2: Parallel computational and close-reading analysis

Our close-reading analysis depended on a fairly traditional historiography presented above. To complement it with computational analysis, we needed a "flyover" of the contents of the corpus. Topic modeling offered us a way to understand how different words and concepts are distributed (equally and unequally) throughout the works of our three journalists, both individually and as a whole. Topic modeling looks at how words occur and co-occur with each other within the context of discrete "chunks" or sections in a larger corpus of text.[^2-11] For our topic models, we chose to use an off-the-shelf combination of  LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing), a less “precise” topic-modeling algorithm, and LDA ("Latent Dirichlet Analysis") for two MMATCH-related reasons. First, while there are algorithms that produce more “precise” topic models, our choice to use MMATCH as a hermeneutic approach meant we could treat our computational analysis as an interpretive layer applied to our primary sources and subject to conversation and revision, rather than as a static single-pass quantitative analysis.[^2-12] Second, to emphasize both the conversational nature of historiography and the need for other methods-driven collaborations to work with our method, LSI is simply easier for other researchers seeking to model their work on ours.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="LSI-Colab" class="margin-toggle sf-hidden">
<span class="sidenote">Repeatable point-and-click versions of code in “notebooks”--we considered both Google Colab Notebooks and Jupyter Notebooks–are a common, easily accessible way to tackle computational analysis. Recent changes to several of the dependencies (or software-installation requirements) for a very popular version of LDA (MALLET) makes it harder to run in these easy-to-use environments, and MMATCH rendered us acutely aware of the need to provide a responsible structured, but also easy to use, approach to computational modeling.</span>

Third, and most important, the topical flyover of our corpus is a means to display and analyze links between the very particular nature of the Spanish-Cuban-American War and a broader US imperial narrative in which that war was framed for public reception. US "Empire" is often explored from within specific boundaries of territoriality, chronology, and US politics. To move past these reified boundaries is difficult for a single historian. A single human brain struggles to predict and accommodate what Paul A. Kramer calls "scalar power" [], an coalescing of power well beyond a single person or a single group of people that reaches into the realm of systemic. An analysis of war correspondence, rooted in the US imperialist mindset, is then an analysis of scalar cultural power, an amalgam of many people telling many overlapping narratives, that build up a particular kind of "truth" that operates at the scale of imperial power. ***ARLENE LANGUAGE TO CLEAN UP: Cultural meaning-making is key in imperialist systems because it shows the mechanisms of expansionism; it transcends chronology and political boundaries/territory while also shaping the narrative of each political boundary around which it weaves. Imperialism as a system invites us to understand the epistemology of others in the war (using MMATCH) while seeing the mechanisms by which the imperial worldview was reproduced by the press, with its particularities of how and why. CITE Kramer, Holt (Semiotics and Representation)**

Integrating distributional text analysis to mimic that scalar power with corpus linguistics to bring the large-scale analysis back down to the level of the individual historical agent (and the individual historian) bridges that gap seamlessly. Topic modeling offers a view into the systemic; Ted Underwood's analog of the flyover, that allows us to see the curvature of the earth that's otherwise invisible from ground level, is a good one. Topic modeling also serves to expose some of the particularities with which we grappled as we worked with our sources in a close-reading approach. **KALANI LANGUAGE TO CLEAN UP One of those choices that linked the very detailed particulars to a broader framework was our decision to keep stopwords intact. We made a few the English corpus because of Michelle Moravec’s work on “she is” BUT articles and pronouns in Spanish do different work. If we removed them, we lost the potential of seeing particulars that don't fit well into world systems in quite the same way, but all of the articles that go with gendered nouns will get in the way anyway.**

[^2-11]: Blei, Schmidt; Underwood?
[^2-12]: Guldi; Schmidt is probably going to hate this, but also we understand distributional stats well enough to accept that these analyses are here to guide us to close reading, not to be a final distant-reading-only approach to our corpus

We chose LSI as a slightly less precise, but still generative, computational analysis approach in Google Colab scaffolded by documented triangulation conversations so that other digital-history teams could reuse our specific MMATCH steps. **OUR CODE IS HERE.** To responsibly address some of the clear methods drawbacks of LSI (vs LDA or TF-IDF[^2-13]), we used coherence models first on all of the authors together and then individually for each author’s work. If topics contain too many similar word pairs, it will be hard for a person to figure out what the difference between topics is. A coherence model offers a measurable way to figure out which number of topics are the most divergent. We also established a need for visualization in our step-1 boundary-and-need conversation: Gensim offers a nice visualization of the word-cluster differences and overlaps between each of the topics, so that we could use both text and visualization to root our Step-3 conversations, which we'll demonstrate with a case study shortly.

Our conversations as we negotiated the boundaries of the study and the first round of our individual results, also helped us identify a need for frequency and co-occurrence analysis--most commonly represented in word-clouds (frequency) and n-grams (co-occurrence)--which allowed us to quickly find and debate the original primary-source contexts of concepts and words in Step 3.

## Steps 3 & 4: Dialogue-based triangulation and Research Revision

With Kalani focused on the historical trends in the corpus with little knowledge of the historical content, and Arlene focused on a selection of the primary sources as a historical content specialist, we formally set aside time for the sort of conversation that happens serendipitously in hallways at conferences, or the type of conversation that happens in scheduled time in history seminars. This interstitial historiographic seminar conversation that triangulates the separate methods analysis included a number of conversations over the course of 2 days, during which we identified a number of questions and patterns that required additional research.[^3-1] We replicate some of those here in THIS EMBEDDED VIDEO THAT DOESN'T EXIST YET ![Arlene and Kalani, conversation and triangulation embedded video]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.urlimg }}ZoomConvo.png)

[^3-1]: The outcome of this stage should be a draft analysis documented clearly, either in the methods section or labeled as “in-progress” analysis in the results section.

Among those considerations were our data cleaning treatment, including our choice of stop words (words that the computational analysis should ignore) and the necessity of handling ambiguities of language that are easy for humans to manage but difficult for computers. For instance, we chose to normalize Hernandez and Hernandes to Hernandez to acknowledge the Spanish-language provenance of the names as well as to fix variabilities in spelling. We made a different choice for issues of inconsistent diacritical marks, this time removing the diacritical marks in predominantly English texts for practical computational reasons. All of these choices were based on our triangulation of close-reading and computational distributional analysis. Finally, we also identified the use of concordance analysis using AntConc (a corpus-linguistics tool that shows all the occurrences of an identified word in their original context) as helpful in scoping out additional close-reading passages and areas of agreement or disagreement in interpretation at the intersection of both of our methods-treatment of the war correspondents' corpora.

One of the topics identified in our topic modeling for Flint offers a good case-study of our work in Steps 3 and 4 of MMATCH. In the topic models drawn from Flint, Kalani noted a topic that depended heavily on the female pronouns "she" and "her". Arlene initially flagged these as references to the Maine, the ship that sank in 1898 and was used to framed the narratives about 1896 and 1897 presented in particular by Flint, for whom the sinking of the Maine introduces his entire text. We went back to the primary source texts using AntConc and the first occurrence we came across was a reference to the wife of a Cuban doctor who traveled with General Gomez and his troops.[^3-2] The difference between Kalani's assumptions about "she" and Arlene's assumptions about "she" suggested a further exploration was necessary.[^3-3] We used co-occurrence pattern searches in AntConc and found 3 separate patterns for "she" and "her". Two had to do with concepts: the Maine as Arlene had originally assumed, though this was a smaller percentage of the total mentions than either of us had expected.[^3-4] More interesting were the references to Cuba as a woman, a nod to unconquered land as feminized and male reinscription of new boundaries through military action in imperial narratives.[3-45]. The other two patterns cohered around women traveling with Gomez' army, including Dr. Hernandez' wife. The most provocative example of these women connected to a fourth pattern that we found as we worked through the references to "she" and "her": an Amazon wielding a machete[^3-5]. Machete-wielding wasn't solely limited to the world of women warriors; instead it anchored a topic in our flyover view of the corpus that, along with several other topics that included "machete" as part of the narrative, that Flint undertook to represent Cuba as too primitive and overgrown for more modern ballistic weapons. **THIS SENTENCE IS TOO LONG**

**VIDEO WALKTHROUGH OF THIS EMBED WITH THE FOCUS ON ALL TOPICS PLUS THE SHE/HER TOPIC, AND THEN AN ANTCONC TREATMENT**

It's anachronistic to use the term "clickbait", but the concept itself is not an anachronism. References to women traveling with the army--and particularly Amazonian women carrying machetes themselves--added a feminized dimension to one of the other topics that caught our attention in the first round of topic models generated by a corpus of all three authors, one that characterized Cuban insurgents as "little men with machetes".[3.6] To understand this topic, our exploration depended on us exploring each author's treatment of Cuban insurgent organization separately. The language Rea deploys that is visible in the flyover view is more militarily formal than Flint: forces, armies, and camps dominate his language about military concerns. In a close-read, this is indicative of the comparatively formal military language he uses to indicate his frustration with limited structure and disorganized rank in a Cuban insurgency that Flint paints with a journalistic, rather than a military, brush. One of Gomez' right-hand men, Bernabe Boza, describes Flint as *el inteligente Yankee* whose work, "although it contains some lies and misjudgements as is common in any work" is "the most impartial and exact [of the work by] war correspondents in the Cuban countryside."[^3-7] Boza goes on to describe Bronson Rea's work as "dishonest, and that "such dishonesty would eventually shame Rea". Boza's take on Flint, and Scovel are as "threhonest journalists" to whom "Cuba will always be thankful for the justice with which they treated the independence cause."[^3-8] Rea is reading Gomez and the Cuban insurgency through the lens of US imperial constructs of military power, the outcome of which is that the Cuban insurgency is an impoverished attempt to mimic "true" imperial power. Flint, on the other hand, only stopped taking notes when he was asleep. Flint's narrative of Gomez' insurgency was still shaped by ideals of US imperialism but less warped by it.

The noble-savage trope conjured up by Amazonian women traveling with their spouses and wielding machetes for the good of their country offered up by Flint, who was considered a more reliable narrator in the eyes of Cuban insurgents themselves, is telling. These findings in the middle stage of our project reflect a thread of newspaper reports about Amazons and other women in Cuba which had a moment of popularity designed to bring flagging American attention back to the war. Flint was only one of several widely read journalists to address reports of women called "mambisas" in the field, but many of these reports shifted the narrative to bring sympathy to helpless women being mistreated in the field on the one hand, in comparison ith Flint's Amazon's on the other.[^3.9] This hook, which scooped the US reader into a journalistic narrative of wild untamed Cuba, with General Gomez as its avatar and his troops as bands of savage warriors, in need of the civilizing force of imperial expansion. Women fighters certainly did exist and were part of the Cuban insurgency, but the combination of computational and close-reading analysis is what led us to the narrative treatment of these women as late-19th-century clickbait.

Kramer's imperial articles also guided us as we considered how best to offer a Cuban perspective on the US perspectives Rea, Scovel and Flint bring to the table. By focusing on US war correspondents' versions of what Cuba is, we addressed imperial impulses, but we also wanted to embed those impulses in a view shaped by Cubans themselves. Adding Gomez/Boza diaries gets at the “danger of one-way thinking” that Kramer brings up and also makes a point we’re making in MMATCH about social-science data collection vs history evidence gathering. So I think it’s historiographically defensible. **KRAMER AND IMPERIALISM LANGUAGE, PLUS BOZA AND GOMEZ TOPIC MODEL OUTCOME**

### Accountability

**Will our close-reads and the historiography we're working with hold true to the flyover view? Are our methods, and the comparison of Cuban perspective to US perspective, actually helping us align with Kramer's call to correction?**

**ARLENE FILL OUT JUN 9-15**: Neutral technocratic good/bad is a manufacturing of good/bad that aligns with imperialist expansionist principles. Silencing the imperialist subjects and making them invisible is a strategy of imperial communication. What is importnat isn't what's real but instead what can be narrated as "real"; reliable, relatabl verisimilitude matters more than the on-the-ground status of Cubans, who are made invisibile in all of the works of war correspondents; they are disappeared in the narrative).[^5.1] The narrative manufactures reality, and that’s what makes language, and our computational approaches to dissociating our positionality from the language, so important so that we can see better. Expansionism is also a key factor in the disappearance of the people of Cuba. By both gendering Cuba as a women (see section on Amazons) and disappearing its people, the war correspondents render Cuba as an empty female waiting to be filled by the presence of imperial forces (whether Cuba's femininty is white and pristine or "mulatto" and dangerous.) CITE FROM INTRO.

[^5.1]: Said from intro; Ugly War Pretty Package.

**KALANI FILL OUT JUN 9-15**: When would-be imperial subjects are visible, they are presented in one of two ways designed to diminish their stature within the pantheon of imperial good/bad. In one case, they are connected to nature and disconnected from the modernity of core imperial life. Gomez, Maceo, and the use of machetes is one of those connections. Women and Gomez use machetes, implicitly feminizing Cuban insurgents and tying them to the world of savage weapons used by savage women who don't know their place. It further accentuates the work we noticed "she" as a pronoun doing in the corpus. machete: Rea and Flint (~20 mentions from Scovel of the 132 hits, it's mostly Rea and Flint)
	- On Maceo: "the sight of him, with his death-dealing machete upraised, was sufficient to cause the Spanish impedimenta to spur on their foaming horses in vain attempts to clear his path" Rea, 302
	- "She led two machete charges" Flint 122 ("Madame Paulina Ruiz Gonzales, wife of Captain Rafael Gonzales, an officer of Pancho Perez, brigadier-general of the Santa Clara division. Some months before she had left her home in Corral Falso by night, and met a party of insurgents on the outskirts of the town.  She rode off, astride an extra horse, to the force of Manolo Menendez").
The genderizing of Cuba pushed us to dig deeper. 
- "She" shows up (Madame Hernandez and Madam Gonzales) but CUBA is also a "she"
- "She" shows up with "machete". We explored some of the gendered structures in the text and found in Rea 136 an little Amazon with a machete (Dr. Hernandez' wife in Flint 122 and 124)
- She = Maine. There are no women in Scovel, which makes you wonder about Scovel's contact with the Cuban insurgents and wonder even more about the role women play in Flint and Rea.
	
**KALANI FILL OUT JUN 9-15**: In the second, they are presented as bumbling or savage: - impediment* badly organized:  (swearing, clattering, according to Flint in 99 and 100), barriers, burdens
Insurgents are
- corpus linguistics: forces, armies, camps. A few chiefs here and there but it's more formal and less barbaric than Rea
- little men with machetes (topic 7).
- chiefs or chieftains, not generals; sympathizers, not troops. It's the language of a barbaric tribe of people
Scovel (writes from 1896 to 1898)

 
These presentations of Gomez and Maceo are, like the genderizing of Cuba, designed to provide an avatar of Cuba and its need to be rescued from its own brave noble savagery. Maceo is an avatar for Cubans in the topic model (shows up regularly with "cuban" and "cubans", topics 1,2,3, 7, 8). Gomez only shows up with concepts of Cubans as people when he is *with* Maceo; he's much more associated with Spain (Spain, Spanishl topics 6, 4). OVERARCHING QUESTION ABOUT GOMEZ AS CONTROVERSIAL (vs Maceo as brave and Black and already established in terms of his braveness, so he’s a less clickbaity character; see Flint section on our identification of clickbait/hook as a thing).

**ARLENE FILL OUT JUN 9-15**:- Maceo is the "truth", the collective representation of the *people* of Cuba.
- Gomez is "fake news", the collective representation of unreliable information about *Spain*. Rea sets him up as an anti-hero to compare to Spain and make Spain not seem so bad.
- lazy: Rea and Scovel again, not Flint
The two together are tropes designed to shape public opinion from the US perspective (also Rea and his corpus-linguistics treatment of unreliable *info*) (This is an example of TRANSCULTURAL move–re: Hulme)
- Insurgents are very formal (more so than Flint but aligned in similar ways)
- Cubans as people, Spain as country (like Rea, but without the avatars of Maceo and Gomez)

**BOTH LATER**: *info* for all of them (Corpus linguistics): Flint is not interested in the reliability of "information" but Rea and Scovel *are* very concerned with reliability of information (they hang out together in 1897 and are potentially influencing each other). Flint visits in 1896, so there's a rupture in the pattern of concern about "reliable information" that is less about author and more about the timing (but the division of the corpora into three smaller chunk helped us see that.)

**BOTH LATER**:  Information and Misinformation
Arlene quote: “Whatever you put it in is whatever you get out.” –i.e. There is no magic wand. You have to curate the sources to be able to produce different visualizations of the sources that allow you to see them ‘anew’, to corroborate what you intuited, or provide more nuance, or add other layers and connections you could not see before. May 16, with Guldi. These tropes of female Cuba, savage Cuba, oversimplified Cuba, all lead us back to the idea of the collective political unconscious in the US about Cuba which justified the war and to which these war correspondents contribute. By stripping Cuba of its nuance, Scovel, Flint and Rea are situating themeslves in a place that their audience will already find comfortable, a framework of transcultural translation that makes an incomprehensible Cuba with its own insurgent forces and its own political will into a comprehensible 'reality' readable through the lens of imperialism and its impulses to conquer and civilize.
