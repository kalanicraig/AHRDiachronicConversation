## How Are Empires—and Imperial Histories—Built?

The invention and maintenance of empire is a complex dance of narrative and action that, together, frame _an_ empire (lowercase, among many empires) as Empire, the only one of its kind that matters for its subjects even in a global context where there are other competing empires.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>See Paul A.

The justification that makes an empire's actions meaningful to its subjects requires a narrative engine that manifests particular values of "good" and "bad" as necessary to maintain the empire's structure. Those values then need to be woven into everyday life, into the daily on-the-ground interactions between imperial agents and local inhabitants.<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Gilbert M.

But it also details a novel methodological structure we used for our historical analysis of those efforts—a combination of collaboration and digital analytical tools that supported our exploration of the hidden themes in sources from both US empire and its imperial subjects, and that we pursued as a corrective to the "danger of one-way thinking" that US historian Paul Kramer cautions against.<label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>This has been an underlying issue among those studying the US empire. In the United States, scholars of American Studies have focused on US empire building yet, as Sophia McClennen, Lázaro Lima, Donald Pease, and historian Louis A. Pérez, Jr. point out, many academic researchers were monolingual and ignored the historical contexts of the places they studied as well as the work by local scholars from colonized or former colonized sites. Therefore, their publications reproduced "an example of US intellectual expansionism" or a historiography "turned on itself, properly self-contained and self-validating." Sophia McClennen "Inter-American Studies or Imperial American Studies?" _Comparative American Studies_ 3, no. 4 (2005): 402; Louis Pérez, Jr., _The War of 1898_ (Chapel Hill, 1998): 110.

The story we tell in this article starts with three US war correspondents who describe the life and character of General Máximo Gómez, a Cuban insurgent general during the Spanish-Cuban-American war.<label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>This essay refers to the United States of America as the "United States" instead of "America" because of the problems associated with naming the people of the United States of America with the name of the whole hemisphere. The term "American" is used interchangeably with "US" only to avoid repetition in some places.</span> Our linguistic analysis of the work of these war correspondents draws on a mixed-method combination of computational linguistic tools and the historian's more "traditional" close reading practices that constitute what historians generally call _the historical method_. Our mixed-method approach also drove us to explore the diaries of Gómez himself and a co-insurrectionist, Bernabé Boza, in order to better understand both the latent and explicit norms that helped build audience expectations in the historical context of the Cuban War of Independence.<label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Cultural analytics and culturomics offer an approach to large-scale patterns of linguistic change as indicators of similarly large-scale patterns of culture or behavior. See: Kalani Craig, "Introduction to Bookworm; Robots Reading Vogue; Bookworm: HathiTrust; Bookworm: Open Library; Building a Bookworm." _Journal of American History_ 105, no.1 (2018): 244-247, https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1093/jahist/jay139; Lev Manovich, Cultural analytics.

We found that, on the one hand, the sensationalist coding of imperial subjects as weak women in need of a strong hand drove support for the imperial project in US media; on the other hand, the _sub rosa_ nature of that narrative meant that its patterns were replicated outside of US media. Even the Cubans studied here did not perceive the encoded expansionist and emasculating narrative in such war correspondence, rooted as it was in a US cultural context. As a consequence, Cuban writers inadvertently reified the hidden norms of US imperial language when they adopted and adapted US imperial language for use in US-facing publications as a framework against which to argue for Cuba's independence, which unintentionally undermined their very arguments for that independence.<label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>On how the secret gathering and public dissemination of information affected the course of Cuba's wars see: Arlene J. Díaz, "Spying on Cubans: A Backstage History of the Spanish-Cuban-American War, 1868-1898" (under contract with University of North Carolina Press).</span>

Our path to uncovering this emasculating aspect of the narrative was the development of MMATCH, or Mixed Method Approaches to Collaborative History, a mixed-methods approach that blends close reading and new historical methods by emphasizing collaboration. As 21st-century historians, we lack the cultural context to make a direct connection between our own limited access to latent 19th-century US language about Cuba and contemporary inadvertent Cuban adaptations of that language. In large part, that's because the epistemology of our work in this article—the how we "know" of history—is rooted in the space between our own positionality, the analysis of primary sources (usually through close-reading practices), and the expertise contained in the historiographic body of secondary sources in which we situate ourselves as scholars of our particular subfield.<label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Leah Shopkow, _The Saint and the Count: A Case Study for Reading like a Historian_ (Toronto, 2021); Bruce A. VanSledright, "On the Importance of Historical Positionality to Thinking about and Teaching History." _International Journal of Social Education_ 12, no. 2 (Fall-Winter 1997-98): 1-18.</span> So, positionally, we faced two problems.

The first is that, as modern historians, our access to the pool of normalized imperial narratives in which 19th-century US imperial subjects were immersed is circumscribed by our inability to time-travel to the 19th-century imperialist milieu that is subtly different than our own 21st-century imperialist and scholarly mindset. To help bridge that gap, therefore, we turned to digital-humanities computational-analysis methods. But that too added complexity to the epistemological stakes of our study. The suspension of a humanistic researcher between personal interpretation, source material, and external scholarly traditions anchors the production of humanities scholarly knowledge in a shared scholarly tradition. Within the confines of those traditions, it can feel disruptive to incorporate digital methods that adapt big-data analytics to understand the role of imperialism in the Cuban War of Independence. While digital humanities scholarship has for more than a decade acknowledged the need for hermeneutic critiques of digital-methods results, each new computational method revives a worry that the analysis spit out by a computer and published without question will overtake a need for human interpretation.<label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell, "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?," in _FAccT '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency,_ March 2021; Ted Underwood, "Mapping the Latent Spaces of Culture," _The Stone and the Shell_ (blog), October 21, 2021, [https://tedunderwood.com/2021/10/21/latent-spaces-of-culture/](https://tedunderwood.com/2021/10/21/latent-spaces-of-culture/).</span>

The second positionality problem in collaborative historical analysis is that a co-authored paper means more than one position to disentangle. Each author brings their world view to the interpretation of their sources, and the questions raised when collaborating on large projects stretch beyond the ability and knowledge of a single scholar. How, then, do individual scholars bring their positionality to bear in a collaborative article that combines many positionalities, much less the added complexity of non-traditional methods?<label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Daniel B.

Zacarias, "Between Oceans and Continents: Slavery in Portuguese Mozambique through Digital Methods in Collaborative Research," _Journal of World History_ 32, no. 2 (2021): 261-280, doi:10.1353/jwh.2021.0024.</span> To address the collaborative aspects of new-methods research, this essay formalizes the importance of interpretive dialogue—of conversation, with ourselves, our sources, and our methods—that is often informal and thus invisible in the formal production of historical scholarship. [[SIDEBAR HERE INTRODUCING KALANI, ARLENE AND DAVID?]]

The five-step MMATCH methodology systematically navigates between traditional close-reading historical analysis and new analytical methods. As part of that systematic process, it simultaneously accommodates the voices of multiple authors. Although some digital-humanities disciplines, like computational linguistics, are attached to scholarly traditions that require formal methods sections, in which both tools and collaboration processes are made visible, in history, formally articulated methods are less common; the ways in which historians work with digital methods, and in collaboration with each other, is often mysterious and, as such, somewhat suspect to historians less familiar with either digital methods or collaborative authorship practices.

This article, then, has three goals. First, it evaluates MMATCH as a productive approach to assessing how historians can integrate new methods such as computational text analysis into their collaborative efforts. Second, it presents our own use of MMATCH to evaluate 19th-century Cuban history by way of the diachronic conversations our collaboration produced, so that each of our authorial perspectives is clear and navigable, both for us during the research process and for readers of our research. Finally, it makes a historiographical claim about 19th-century audience expectations that we could not have achieved without MMATCH, which allowed us to negotiate how we blended more traditional close-reading methods with digital tools.

## The Historiographic Stakes of 19th-century Cuba and US Imperial Norms

A traditional "close-reading" approach to both primary and secondary sources that document the two wars of Cuban independence in the 19th century offers a tug-of-war narrative that positions would-be independent countries like Cuba at the crossroads of the US war with Mexico, the forced displacement of Native Americans from their homelands, and the abolition of slavery in the United States. These wars, the xenophobia, and abolitionist impulses alike were characteristic of 19th-century Western expansionism, a trend that coincided with and was bolstered by the new journalism of the late 1890s. Members of expeditions, travelers, and reporters were all important historical agents of expansionist practices, and their impulse to record their journeys rendered foreign climes comprehensible for a US audience thirsty to know about the world outside the US mainland. These journalists and war correspondents became, as Peter Hulme would have it, "agents of transculturation," because "they passed as interpreters of Cuban culture to a US readership." Among the elite global travelers, journalists (and, we would add, scholars) were "perhaps the most open, in that their raison d'ȇtre is to write, and so they leave records of their interpretations."<label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Peter Hulme, "Across the Tropic Line: Reporters and Spies in Cuba in Times of Strife" in Sebastian Jobs and Gesa Mackenthun, eds., _Agents of Transculturation: Border-Crossers, Mediators, Go-Betweens_ (Munster, 2013): 245-261; Salvatore, _Disciplinary Conquest_.</span> Some agents of transculturation would, vested with the authority they automatically acquired as first-hand observers, undermine and sabotage the foreign people they wrote about, as "translation is often the means at hand to strike the blow."<label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Hulme, "Across the Tropic Line," 255.</span>

Of particular interest in the late 1890s were stories about Cuban insurgent generals—especially General Máximo Gómez and General Antonio Maceo—both respected military men whose fame dated back to Cuba's First War of Independence (1868-78) and to the subsequent Third War that General Maceo fought in 1879-80.<label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Ada Ferrer, _Insurgent Cuba_, (Chapel Hill, 1999): 52-64, 70-89, 144-149; and _Cuba: An American History_, (New York, 2021): 129-166.</span> By the time the Third War was under way in 1895, the strong competition for news made it imperative for US newspaper editors to create suspense and expectation by sending reporters to the interior of Cuba in search of "true accounts" of the insurgents. Indeed, in spring of 1896, three young war correspondents—Sylvester Scovel, George Bronson Rea, and Grover Flint—each in their late twenties and with a rudimentary command of the Spanish language, crossed into insurgent territory in the eastern Cuban countryside to interview primarily Gómez.<label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Scovel learned some Spanish while in Cuba, yet he—like many correspondents—had Cuban-born interpreters working for them. Rea achieved an adequate command of Spanish from his previous five years working in the island, and Flint learned some of the language while he lived in Spain. Sylvester Scovel, "_Autobiographical Sketch_" Missouri Historical Society Archives, Sylvester Scovel Papers; Joyce Milton, _The Yellow Kids_ (New York, 1985): 66-70. Charles H. Brown, _A Correspondent's War_ (New York, 1967): 44, 50.</span> While Maceo, who was an intriguing personality to US readership, a mulatto hero whose bravery and military talent won him a high rank in the insurgency as well as indisputably wide popular respect, did earn some attention, it was less than Gómez.

Born in 1836 in the Dominican Republic, Gómez initially enrolled in his country's army to curtail Haitian incursions into the eastern side of the Hispaniola in the 1850s (Figure 1). He then became incorporated into the Spanish military when the Dominican Republic was annexed to Spain between 1861-1865. But, once Spain was expelled from a politically independent Dominican Republic in 1865, he was transferred to Cuba, where he requested his discharge from the Spanish military and joined the Cuban insurgency when the First War of Independence erupted on October 10, 1868. He quickly ascended to become one of the top military leaders.<label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>_Diccionario enciclopédico de historia militar de Cuba._ Vol. 1 (La Habana, 2004): 161-164.</span> Gómez's public reputation had two distinctly different elements. In a nutshell, "old man" Gómez's unconventional, non-Western military tactics were characterized as "uncivilized" by Cuban elites, even though they struck fear into his enemies, while his well-known fits of temperament also provided pretext for criticism by some rebels who cited his status as a "foreigner" in their mistrust of his leadership of the Cuban insurgency.

</figure>

On the one hand, Gómez was well respected as a cold, calculating military strategist; he waged war with very limited war equipment and few trained soldiers, emphasizing small-scale guerrilla ambushes with machetes. He aimed for a long, irregular war that would curtail Spanish financial resources, which included burning the fields of anyone who did not support the revolution.

His cold calculations extended to harnessing the value of US reporters stirring up public interest in the war in Cuba. As his diary attests, General Gómez welcomed encounters with the press, and the press reciprocated the attention because Gomez's reputation as a ruthless disciplinarian could grab the attention of readers, including those who opposed him. For example, he meted out the death penalty for the smallest act of perceived treason, a headline-worthy but strict authoritarian approach reviled by the insurgency's top leadership and wealthy Cubans, who accused him of being an "uncivilized" military man, a _caudillo_ (strongman), and a dictator. He was also accused of participating in the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years War (1868-78). Signed and negotiated by wealthy insurgent leaders, the pact was loathed by the rest of the insurgents because it did not address the abolition of slavery and political independence from Spain that drove the First War.<label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Ferrer, _Insurgent Cuba_, 60-69; Yoel Cordoví Núñez, _Máximo Gómez tras las huellas del Zanjón_ (Santiago de Cuba, 2005); Santiago Castro Ventura, _Máximo Gómez: Del abismo a la gloria_ (Santo Domingo, 2006); Florencio Garcia Cisneros, _Máximo Gómez: ¿Caudillo o dictador?_(Miami, 1986).</span> During the Third War (1895-1898), General Gómez was also blamed for not preventing the 1895 killing of Cuban intellectual and rebel leader José Martí.

The first of the three correspondents to interview the Cuban generals, Sylvester Scovel, arrived in Cuba in October of 1895, motivated to make the journey by the lack of direct reporting from the island (Figure 2). He was initially hired by the _New York Herald_, but had moved to Joseph Pulitzer's _New York World_ by January of 1896. Since February of 1896, when Scovel sent his first articles to the _World_, the newspaper had anticipated and created suspense around Scovel's reporting. He was featured as a brave and daring correspondent, one who "tells, not rumors, but what he sees," and as one who seeks "authentic news of the Cuban patriots. Correspondents possessed great qualities in the public imagination as adventurers and as transcultural agents, and Scovel fit the bill perfectly: "Mr. Scovel has shown that he combines all the great and high qualities of the war correspondent's devotion to duty, accuracy, graphic descriptive power, absolute courage and skill both in getting the news and in sending it through the enemy's lines to his newspaper."<label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>William Shaw Bowen, "Sylvester Scovel Banished," _New York World,_ January 18, 1896; "Rebels Never More Hopeful," _New York World_, January 7, 1897; "A Brave Correspondent," _New York World_, January 8, 1897.</span> In fact, his news stories were among the few whose authorship was acknowledged at the time.

Shortly after Scovel arrived, George Bronson Rea landed on Cuban ground. Rea had become a correspondent for the _New York Herald_ after joining the US Navy and spending five years as an engineer modernizing sugar-producing machinery in US-owned plantations in Cuba. On January 18, 1896, he left Havana to join General Gómez's army, where he stayed for nine months, with orders to send the newspaper "the exact truth" of the situation in Cuba.<label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Leslie Eaton Clark, _George Bronson Rea, Propagandist_ (Madison, 2016): 7-45; George Bronson Rea, _Facts and Fakes About Cuba._ (New York, 1897): 314.</span> While Rea did write some news stories, it was his book, _Facts and Fakes About Cuba_, published in 1897, that galvanized attention (Figures 3a and 3b). The book blamed Cuban _laborantes_ (Cuban insurgent sympathizers who sent stories supporting their cause to the US press) for the misinformation in the United States on the war. Rea pointedly called out untruthful reporting and took special aim at defaming General Gómez, both tactics that rendered Rea's narrative a more positive view of the Spanish side of the war. The leitmotif of the book was General Gómez's public insults to and threats against Rea, whom Gómez saw as representative of a newspaper biased in favor of Spain. In turn, Gómez's treatment prompted Rea to reconsider his initial favorable opinion of the Cuban insurgency.

The last correspondent on the scene was the _New York Journal_'s Grover Flint, who arrived in Cuba in March 1896 to spend four months reporting on General Gómez. Flint spent his time in Cuba mainly in the provinces of Camagüey, Las Villas, and Matanzas, during which period he was able to send only four dispatches from the field, augmented by some of his own illustrations (Figure 4). [[EMBED PIC OF FLINT AND HIS BOOK]] Yet it was his book, _Marching with Gómez_, published in 1898, that gave Flint notoriety.<label for="sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Brown, _A Correspondents' War_, 50; Grover Flint, _Marching with Gómez; A War Correspondent's Field Notebook, Kept During Four Months with the Cuban Army_ (Boston, 1898).</span> According to his father-in-law, John Fiske, who wrote the introduction of the book, Flint, like Scovel and Rea, was in Cuba

with the purpose of obtaining correct information as to what was going on in the island. A brief stay at Havana was enough to assure him that the information received in that city was likely to be anything but correct. He therefore made up his mind to break away and visit the insurgents, in order to satisfy himself by ocular inspection as to the various points upon which he wished to be informed. Some experience of life on the Plains as a soldier in the United States army had prepared him for the kind of adventures involved in the undertaking…<label for="sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Flint, _Marching with Gómez_, xxix.</span>

Even in the earliest pages of Flint's book, the historical Spanish presence in the North American hemisphere is described as "odious" and in need of ending, and the Cuban insurgents' cause is commended. As even further evidence of this leaning, Flint highlights the atrocities committed by the Spaniards and describes General Gómez in a far more positive light than Rea, even though Flint, Rea, and Scovel frequently witnessed the same fights.

## Bridging the Gap Between Epistemological Conundrums and Collaborative History: Mixed-Method Approaches to Collaborative History (MMATCH)

The news stories by Scovel and the books by Rea and Flint provide a unique opportunity to dig deeper into the ways these correspondents translated General Gómez—as the character of an insurgent leader, as a bellwether for the war in Cuba, and as an avatar of both Cuba and Spain—to US readers. What words did they select to talk about General Gómez, what meanings or sentiments did these writers communicate with those words, and what does this say about the different representations of Cuba addressed to a US readership? How did their stories seek to grab the public's attention and what semiotic strategies did they use in their representations of Cuba to make their foreign reality intelligible to the American audience? And how does our positionality as modern scholars embedded in a different kind of empire shape our reading of these sources?

Mixed-Method Approaches to Collaborative History, or MMATCH, is designed to address each of these questions, as separate questions and in a syncretic continuum, by acknowledging the role of many-layered hermeneutic traditions.<label for="sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>"In digital humanities research we use tools, make tools, and theorize tools not because we are all information scientists, but because tools are the formal instantiation of methods."

By marking all of these spaces as formal sites of authorship, MMATCH both surfaces the unacknowledged silences historians gloss over in our emphasis on solo-author monographs and emphasizes the need to articulate methods within a historical argument, and therefore to offer a transparent accounting of the nature and treatment of results drawn from digital tools or other historical methods not rooted in close-reading approaches.

MMATCH is comprised of five steps, which we will lay out first in terms broad enough to suit most mixed-method collaborative authorship teams and then more narrowly for our specific focus on the Cuban War of Independence:

1. _Sourcing_: Initial agreement on the boundaries of primary and secondary sources, on possible analytical paths, and on individual roles for each researcher.
2. _Parallel interpretation_: Separate scholarly analysis that addresses the individual positionality and methods specialties of each researcher in the collaboration.
3. _Dialogue-based triangulation_: Interstitial and informal negotiation that integrates the separate methods analyses and synthesizes the historiographic conventions each researcher brings to the project. Step 3 outlines revised analysis goals for Step 4.
4. _Revised parallel and/or joint interpretation_: A cyclical round of formal and informal conversation that includes individual interpretation and potential methods changes resulting from the conversation in Step 3; Steps 3 and 4 may repeat several times and need not be done in isolation, as is also true of Step 2. The analytical results of Steps 3 and 4 should either be clearly documented in a separate methods section, or clearly labeled as mid-stage analysis in the case of a more traditional narrative structure.
5. _Formal written results_: While this stage includes the narrative text that is generally thought of as constituting historical scholarship, it should also include a methods section that documents how the authorship team structured steps 1-4. The methods section may also identify a particular mode of audience engagement (static reception, interactive exploration of _capta_, hybrid) that is identified in Steps 3 and 4 particularly.

Related methodological models help position the MMATCH approach as building on, as well as new to, both humanities and social-science versions of the historical method. On the humanities side, which privileges the interpretation of an individual, several practices align with MMATCH. Johanna Drucker's concept of _capta_ suggests that humanities "data" require interpretive intervention—a form of analysis itself—prior to being subjected to computational analysis. Data, Drucker says, are given whole to the researcher, a complete set of prefabricated information that can be analyzed with minimal transformation. _Capta_ are captured, quite literally taken by a researcher from unstructured evidence and transformed into structured information through humanistic interpretation.<label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Johanna Drucker, "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display," _Digital Humanities Quarterly_ 5, no. 1 (2011), [http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html).</span> In the MMATCH model, _capta_ offer insight into a computational black box, a computational tool or algorithm that is otherwise opaque and hard to understand.

On the output side of the historian's interaction with the computational black box is what Jo Guldi describes as "critical searching," in which the individual historian performs a critical reading of computational outputs as though the results are themselves a source. MMATCH offers an explicit framework in which scholars can articulate how closely aligned their treatment of the results are with the close-reading of primary sources. In both cases, _capta_ and the mechanism of critical search necessitate a critique of the entire historical method, including the digital tools and the results such tools provide.<label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Jo Guldi, "Critical Search: A Procedure for Guided Reading in Large-Scale Textual Corpora." _Journal of Cultural Analytics_ 3, no. 1, (2018), [https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.22148/16.030](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.22148/16.030).</span>

The MMATCH framework extends this methods-critique model and makes the critical apparatus in non-traditional history transparent by positioning the humanities scholar as an interlocutor for the computational methods. However, neither _capta_ nor critical-search approaches address the fact that individual interpretation can circumscribe collaborative efforts. MMATCH also closes that gap by bringing the formal historiographic conversation and informal seminar discussion together in service of collaborative _capta_ and critical interpretation of computational models.

MMATCH refocuses Trianguluation Design away from empirical, repeatable results and toward humanities heuristics by documenting the value of informal discussions that often contribute meaningfully to the development of historical scholarship but are dismissed because, as "conversations," they cannot be cited and there are no norms for including conversational partners in author lists. MMATCH instead positions the conference-hallway conversation, and other similar interactions, as the primary site of both _capta_ collection and analysis. It builds a collaborative positionality among the credited authors of a piece of historical analysis while still offering a transparent, repeatable _process_ even if the _results_ aren't necessarily empirically reproducible. The epistemological stakes of this approach, then, are threefold:

- It offers an epistemologically sound solution to scholars interested in a digital-methods approach to their research question but for whom the method is a serious barrier to entry.
- It models a fair, equitable research-collaboration practice for traditionally single-author disciplines by
    - extending the literature on individual interpretation and hermeneutics to a collaborative model based in existing historical-methods practices, and
    - expanding access to the world of scholarly production to anyone contributing a voice to these informal scholarly conversations.
- It offers a model for discipline-wide development of a formal literature in historical methods, which values the development, articulation, and presentation of new methods; the communication of those new methods to practitioners with a range of interest in those new methods; and the centrality of collaborative hermeneutics.<label for="sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-28" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>See "The web is not print.

By interpolating our conversations and computational text analysis, MMATCH simultaneously offers an interpretive view of historical data to the reader while also changing the researcher's interpretive lens. That change is necessary to our improved understanding of our own present-day positionality and how that present-day context shapes our ability or inability to engage with the historical perspectives of our subjects. These choices acknowledge our individual centers of expertise and, in encouraging a collaborative process that makes the translational leap from computational model to close-read historical analysis, hit a middle ground between computational analysis hermeneutics that shape the historiographic conversation and its contributors. We hope ultimately that MMATCH will make it easier to facilitate the training of interdisciplinary and inter-specialty historians and provide a collaborative approach to the writing of methods-driven history.

## MMATCH in Integrating Computational and Close-Reading Histories of the Cuban War of Independence

We developed MMATCH to scaffold a general process that suited both our mixed-methods history collaborations and other new-methods collaborations of many kinds. In turn, MMATCH helped us tell a complex story about Cuba and its people as they were represented by war correspondents of the late 1890s. What follows is a very brief roadmap that connects our research questions and process to the steps in MMATCH, and then MMATCH-guided accounting of our choices, our findings, and our contributions to the historiography of the Third Cuban War of Independence.

As with all historical research, we started with a research question and sourcing. In MMATCH Step 1, we identified our three US war correspondents—Scovel, Flint, and Rea—as representative sources of US imperialist language that also share a common engagement with Cuban military leaders. MMATCH Step 1 also sees us diverging from other historical monographs and articles because we needed to establish each of our individual authorial perspectives and areas of methodological expertise in order to proceed to MMATCH Step 2 [[see sidebar on page XXXXX introducing the authors]]. In Step 2, we drew on our established positionality and methodological preferences to separately analyze our sources. Arlene drew on traditional close-reading methods and her familiarity with Caribbean historiographic trends centered on imperialism, while Kalani rewrote a set of topic-modeling approaches initially developed by David in order to explore latent trends in how words co-occurred across the corpus of all three correspondents.<label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>CyberDH at IUB, Jupyter Notebook: [https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/TopicModeling/LDA/script](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/TopicModeling/LDA/script). David customized this for a different set of sources for Arlene; it uses an integration of MALLET (an LDA topic modeler) and GenSim, our visualization tool, that no longer functions.</span> In MMATCH Step 3, we explored the structures of cultural mnemonics together, using our separate analyses from Step 2 to triangulate our results. That is, we identified overlaps, gaps, differences, and similarities in our findings from the close-reading and digital-methods approaches, which exposed a potential gap in our ability to understand our sources as outsiders to the cultural norms of late 19th-century US print media. Our computational analysis exposed several latent patterns about women in the Cuban insurgency that we didn't understand in our sources, and our close-reading analysis suggested that we might include two Cuban sources (Boza and Gómez) so that we could explore whether the latent patterns in our US sources were replicated in contemporary Cuban sources. In Step 4, we worked with the original three US sources in English and the two Cuban sources in Spanish, revising our findings during several in-person conversations. In these conversations, we used the computational analysis to guide close-reading treatment of several passages that connected latent patterns about women to the feminization, and subsequent diminishment, of Cuban rebels as capable of self-rule, which we outline in Step 5 below.

### Step 1: Sourcing, Periodization, and Corpus Building

In this first step, MMATCH prompted us to consider our selection of primary sources from both a historiographic lens (what we were reading) and a computational-text-analysis lens. We selected the sources that would best generate a guided computational reading that could be treated as a quasi-primary source alongside our primary sources. Our concern in Step 1 was the alignment of our corpus building—that is, the development and organization of a set of sources that can be read by both historians and computers—with our initial research question about potential latent patterns of imperialist language to which we, as modern historians, did not have cultural access. The interviews with General Gómez that appear in the news stories by Scovel (1896-1898), and the books by Rea (1897) and Flint (1898) were readily available for close-reading approaches, but we needed these texts to be computer readable, and we needed to align how the computer "saw" them with how a historian might see them. To that end, we digitized our sources and performed Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on them to transform scanned images into typed computer-readable text.<label for="sn-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-30" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>We benefitted from the transcriptions of many of Scovel's 1898 news stories done by Darien Elizabeth Andreu, "Sylvester H.

To that collection we added other articles by Scovel extracted from microfilm and digital newspaper libraries.</span>

### Step 2: Parallel Computational and Close-Reading Analysis

Arlene's analysis depended in part on a fairly traditional historiography rooted in Caribbean history and US imperialist historiography, as outlined above. For our computational approach, we initially chose topic modeling, an unsupervised "bucket-of-words" approach that, without the use of a dataset trained by a human being, analyzes a set of texts for collections of words that appear frequently together.<label for="sn-31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-31" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>David M.

This bucket-of-words approach scans for words that co-occur regularly in the same chunk—that is, those two words are distributed similarly in similar chunks of our corpus—and provides a word-distribution report containing several topics ("buckets") to which many digital humanists apply interpretation in much the same way they might interpret a primary source.

Topic modelling enabled us to understand how different words and concepts are distributed (equally and unequally) throughout the works of our three journalists, whether individually or overall, but we needed an additional preparation step for our texts so that our topic modelling output matched our close-reading practices as closely as possible.<label for="sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Ted Underwood, "Topic Modeling Made Just Simple Enough," _The Stone and the Shell_ (blog), 2012, accessed December 26, 2022,.https://tedunderwood.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/.</span> To that end, we "chunked," or divided, our sources into meaningful sections that roughly align with how a historian might understand the authors' original organization of the texts.<label for="sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-33" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>We chose to divide our texts into human-readable sections, rather than equally sized "chunks" of 250 or 500 words. While the distributional model of topics will be more defensible in terms of its statistical validity, we aren't depending on the topic model as a result in itself but as a primary source of its own which can be used alongside the original text, to guide our interpretation.</span> For Scovel, that meant each article became a discrete text file; for Rea and Flint, we divided by chapter to facilitate the use of parallel computational text analysis and close-reading analysis.

MMATCH and its emphasis on positionality and transparency also helped us choose an appropriate topic-modeling tool from the many available topic modelers. In conversations about how we would use topic models leading up to our Step 2 analysis, we found ourselves talking about the topic models as though they were a hybrid source that sat somewhere between primary source and secondary source. This consideration of digital output as an analyzable "primary-ish" source makes digital methods more accessible to other scholars with less technical skill. The approach also allowed us to treat our topic model results more holistically;p that is, our analysis does not rest solely on the statistical weight of the topic models but instead sits in the intersitial space between primary and secondary source.<label for="sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>A number of scholarly works support the critical and/or hermeneutic treatment of digital-methods results, rather than reducing the model to the statistical significance of words co-occurring in a topic.

Daniel Shore, _Cyberformalism: Histories of Linguistic Forms in the Digital Archive_ (Baltimore, 2018).</span> We found, however, that none of the existing literature makes a direct parallel between the primary sources and the digital analysis of primary sources as "primary source-ish". MMATCH helped us identify, articulate, and negotiate the parallel between how we were treating our primary sources and digital analyses early in our planning process. We used the flexibility that treatment of the topic model gave us to further explore the clues it surfaced with the primary sources and put those clues "in conversation" with our other analyses, our shared expertise, and existing historiography in the field.

Our choice to treat the topic model as akin to a primary source meant, then, that we could be less concerned with statistical validity than if we had accepted the topic-model results as a set analytical model that spoke for itself and needed little interpretation. As a consequence, we chose to use an off-the-shelf topic-modeling process supported in an easy-to-use point-and-click cloud-based interface that would be more accessible to other researchers seeking to model their work on ours.<label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Michael D. Gordon and Susan Dumais, "Using Latent Semantic Indexing for Literature Based Discovery," _Journal of the American Society for Information Science_ 49, no. 8 (1998): 674–685; Blei, _et.al_., "Latent Dirichlet Allocation." Repeatable point-and-click versions of code in "notebooks" (we considered both Google Colab Notebooks and Jupyter Notebook) are a common, easily accessible way to tackle computational analysis. Recent changes to several of the dependencies (or software-installation requirements) that broke our go-to topic modeler's notebook-based interface with the GenSim visualization tool made us acutely aware of the need to provide a responsible, structured, but also easy-to-use approach to computational modeling. For the original GenSim topic model notebook, visit [https://colab.research.google.com/github/littlecolumns/ds4j-notebooks/blob/master/text-analysis/notebooks/Topic%20models%20with%20Gensim.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/littlecolumns/ds4j-notebooks/blob/master/text-analysis/notebooks/Topic%20models%20with%20Gensim.ipynb) . For our notebook, which has been modified to switch between our corpora, and to generate coherence models, see [http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/0\_Topic\_models\_with\_Gensim\_Commented.ipynb.](http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/0_Topic_models_with_Gensim_Commented.ipynb.)</span> The balance between distributional precision and ease of use also supported the ease with which we could share our actual code. We made minimal adaptations to a pre-scripted notebook available in Google Collab's cloud-based platform—mostly oriented toward easy switching between one primary-source corpus and another—so that other historians can draw on our methodological approach in both the computational and conversational realms.<label for="sn-36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-36" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>We used coherence models to accommodate the "less precise" nature of our approach to topic models. A coherence model offers a measurable way to determine how many topics a historian should request from a topic model run on a specific corpus to produce topics that are sufficiently divergent from each other. If a word appears many times, it can be distributed to many topics if it appears clustered with a broad variety of other words. If the same words and word clusters appear in many of the topics in a topic model, making it difficult for a human reader to quickly differentiate between the contents of each topic. A coherence model, run first on all of the authors together and then individually for each author's work, suggested that our all-correspondent corpus would benefit from between 15 and 20 topics and our individual-correspondent corpora could support 7 to 10 topics.</span>

Finally, we also established two reasons for the need for visualization in our Step 1 boundary-and-need conversation. First, we wanted both textual and visual methods to identify latent patterns in the primary-source language. Second, we wanted a point-and-click interface that facilitated the communication of results to historians who might want to understand our methods but not replicate them. Topic models run in the Google Collab environment supported the inclusion of accompanying visualizations of the topic models using a library called "GenSim," which offers several visualizations of the word-cluster differences and overlaps between each of the topics (described below).

Because many words appear several times across the original text in a corpus, those words might appear in several topics. For example, machete co-occurs with a wide variety of other words in several chunks in Flint's corpus, so "machete" appears in several topics as a result. Exploring the topics to see how words like "machete" are distributed can be done through two visualizations presented side by side. On the left, topics are represented as bubbles. An overlap between bubbles indicates that there are overlaps in the distribution of the words that make up different topics. Bubbles representing topics made up of many words in the corpus are larger; topics that are far away from each other on the bubble-chart axes are composed of words that appear less frequently together. Choosing a bubble from the left-hand visualization brings up the list of words represented in that topic on the right, using bar-graph representations to indicate word frequency in a particular topic.

### Step 3: A Dialogue-Based Triangulation, or Informal Historiography

In our parallel-analysis phase, Kalani focused on the linguistic trends in the corpus, rooting her exploration more in the computational analysis using only basic knowledge of the historical content. Arlene, who is a historical content expert, focused on close reading a selection of the primary sources. With that parallel analysis completed, we set aside several scheduled blocks of time over the course of two days to make room for Step 3, the sort of wide-ranging fluid conversation that happens in history seminars. Normally these informal conversations would sit in an interstitial space between stages of formal analysis; to facilitate formal record keeping without interrupting the informal flow of conversation, we recorded our meetings and then returned to the transcripts to identify questions and patterns that required additional research.

One of the topics we immediately identified in our first conversation about topic modeling for the Flint-only corpus is instructive for both the historical argument we offer here as well as for how MMATCH increases the transparency of our analysis in Steps 3 and 4. In these models, Kalani noted a topic (#7) that depended heavily on the feminine pronouns "she" and "her"; adjusting the "relevance metric" slider in the topic model downward to .2 from 1.0, which displays words that are more closely linked to that topic than the other computer-generated topics, highlights "she" and "her" even more dramatically as the top two words that are unique to this topic

Arlene initially flagged these as references to the _USS Maine_, the ship that sank in February 1898 and was used to frame the narratives about 1896 and 1897 presented by Flint, for whom the sinking of the USS Maine introduced his entire text. The difference between Kalani's assumptions about "she" and Arlene's assumptions about "she" from the topic model sent us back to the original language in our primary sources for the roots of these latent patterns, which in turn led us to corpus-linguistics analysis.

The first occurrence of the feminine pronouns we came across in AntConc was a reference to the wife of a Cuban doctor who traveled with General Gómez and his troops and suggested the necessity for further exploration.<label for="sn-38" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-38" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>To generate this screen capture of AntConc, we loaded the entirety of our English-language corpus (Rea, Scovel, and Flint), and then used the co-occurrence tab to search for words that co-occur 5 within 5 words ??? of "she" (before or after).</span> Using co-occurrence pattern searches in AntConc, we found three distinct patterns for "she" and "her." Two of the three patterns tied the idea of female-gendered pronouns to things or concepts. One was in fact the _USS Maine,_ along with other military vessels, though this represented a far smaller percentage of the total mentions than either of us had expected, an inaccurate assumption likely grounded in the pervasive US narrative of the war.<label for="sn-39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-39" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Based on keyword-in-context analysis (KWIC tab in AntConc), where we search for a word and get search returns of the full sentences surrounding that keyword, Scovel mostly uses "she" for the Maine, in about 20% of his mentions. The remainder of Scovel's uses of "she" refer to Spain or Cuba, then to Clara Barton, and then to other ships. For the other two US sources, Spain, Cuba, and women in the war were far more common than "she" references to ships.</span> The second pattern was comprised of references to "she" and "her" that characterized Cuba and Spain as a woman.<label for="sn-40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-40" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>McClintock, _Imperial Leather,_ 26-30.</span> The remaining AntConc pattern cohered around the women who travelled with Gómez's army, including Dr. Hernández's wife.

This third latent pattern connected the she/her references from topic #7 to a word that appeared in several topics not limited to the "she" and "her" topic but which moves to the top 4 when the relevance-metric slider is adjusted down to .2: the machete. In our initial close-reading analysis of "she" and "her" across all three sources, we noted mention of women warriors wielding a machete. In the flyover view of Flint's corpus, machete-wielding wasn't limited to the world of women warriors, but it did overlap and it has an implicit value that associates women warriors with the Amazons that are presented in other US-facing newspaper articles about the war in Cuba.<label for="sn-41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-41" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>See footnote 51 CONFIRM FOOTNOTE NUMBER IS STABLE CITE for examples of Amazons and other "pretty girls" wielding machetes in 1896-1897 US newspapers.</span> The combination of Cuba represented as a woman, and the Cuban insurgency as having women and men in its ranks, both wielding the same weapon, sent us down a path of exploration centered around the machete.

While it might seem out of context to apply the term "clickbait" to the era we are talking about, the concept itself is very apt. References to women traveling with the army—and particularly Amazonian women carrying machetes—added a feminized dimension to one of the other topics that caught our attention in the first round of topic models generated by a corpus of all three authors, one that characterized Cuban insurgents as what we began to refer to as "little men with machetes."<label for="sn-42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-42" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Topic 7 in Flint-only Topic Model: [[LINK] [http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/Flint\_10.html#topic=7&lambda=1&term=](http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/Flint_10.html#topic=7&lambda=1&term=) ]] . Entering "little" as a search term into AntConc using our corpus [[CORPUS LINK?]] demonstrates the full reach of the diminutive language Flint imposed on his Cuban subjects.</span>

Both male and female insurgents, whether laypersons or leaders, were associated with machetes in our topic model, highlighting an overlap that keyed us into a feminization angle of the "uncivilized" trope that we hadn't previously considered. The "she/her" topic was connected through the word "machete" to several topics in Flint's source that marked "machete" as part of the implicit narrative of Cuba's insurgency as underdeveloped and incapable of self-governance. Rather than modern weapons designed specifically for men at war, machetes were coded as agricultural tools, suited for marching through overgrown territory. Flint's image of a simple tool wielded by women in wild territory had the effect of diminishing the masculinity and the intellect of the men who wielded those same machetes.

Flint's outlier female-pronoun topic pushed us to dig deeper into the three texts and ask several crucial questions: Was Flint's trope about Amazons a vehicle to draw attention to and align his text with an expansionist narrative more familiar to US readers? If so, how did each author represent the Cuban insurgent organization and leadership? And what, if any, parallels did those descriptions have to the gendered depiction of the war in Cuba?

With those questions in mind, we searched "Gómez" in AntConc; we chose "Gómez" because the word is present in all the topics for Flint, and Flint because he had taken great pains to understand and justify General Gómez's character and war strategies. For instance, Flint validated Gómez's stormy temperament as one facet of a general's need to discipline his army, especially one whose large number of Black soldiers, many of whom had until recently been enslaved, were assumed to lack order and morale:

It is not usual, in armies, for a commander to publicly reprimand officers, even non-commissioned officers. It is supposed to destroy the authority of their rank; but Gómez, I think, did so for a purpose. He was surrounded by men unused to weighing points of honor with nicety. Though well meaning, they were ignorant of many things, and these lectures, generalizing on what a man owed to himself and to the fatherland, gave them new ideas. Gomez' sayings were widely repeated, and the moral tone of the army was raised.<label for="sn-43" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-43" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Flint, _Marching with Gomez_, 193.</span>

Yet, while Flint explained and praised Gómez's character here, he also undermined him elsewhere by repeating the adjective "little" when referring to the general and his weapon, incidentally another computationally-generated topic of his book:<label for="sn-44" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-44" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Topic 7 in Flint-only Topic Model: [http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/Flint\_10.html#topic=7&lambda=1&term=](http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/Flint_10.html#topic=7&lambda=1&term=)</span>

Flint's narrative effectively emasculates the general even when explaining the reasoning behind his behavior in the context of the war. Gómez becomes a giant with a purpose, yet his "little machete" from Santo Domingo—synonymous in the Western world with Black "savagery" could be interpreted as weak because curved—not manly enough to defend the land and the women from Spanish cruelty and barbarism.<label for="sn-46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-46" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>In contrast to what Flint says, the machetes used by insurgent leaders were "long, heavy and single-edged." General Máximo Gómez's machete, for example, measured 33.8 inches, while the one that Antonio Maceo wielded when he died was 28.7 inches.[https://www.thecubanhistory.com/2019/03/el-machete-terrible-weapon-of-war-of-the-cubans-photos/](https://www.thecubanhistory.com/2019/03/el-machete-terrible-weapon-of-war-of-the-cubans-photos/) This contrasted with the machetes used by enslaved people to cut cane—the '_mocho_'—which were much shorter, worn-out, tipless, and usually made from broken pieces of a longer machete. Using a mocho required enslaved workers to bend down to get closer to the roots of the sugarcane stem and, if used as a weapon, to be physically closer to an enemy to defend themselves.</span> Flint's repetitious description of the General's weapon is further emphasized by a drawing he made of it [[(Figure \*\*).]] Whether unconscious or not, in Flint's text, the European sword is a referent to which he could compare Gómez's machete, an agricultural tool and war weapon whose Spanish name is possibly derived from the word "macho" [male].<label for="sn-47" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-47" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Joan Corominas, _Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico_, vol. 3 (Madrid, 1980): 746.</span>

Even though it was nearly three feet long, Flint repeatedly presented the machete as small, an underhanded dig drawing on cultural depictions of the size of the sword as an indicator of its bearer's masculine virility, both intellectual and physical.<label for="sn-48" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-48" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>For a roughly contemporary exploration of swords, citizenship, and masculinity in the Caribbean, see Mimi Sheller, _Citizenship from Below: Erotic Agency and Caribbean Freedom_ (Durham, 2012): 142-165.</span> Scovel, too, conjured images of the machete as "short", and the people who used machetes as "inexperienced forces", another dig at the Cuban army's virility as men and viability as an offensive force.<label for="sn-49" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-49" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Scovel, "GEN. GOMEZ'S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD."

The image of near-Amazonian women traveling with their spouses and wielding machetes for the good of their country is also indicative of another train of late 1890s "clickbait" that Flint had internalized even though he was considered a more reliable narrator in the eyes of Cuban insurgents themselves (see below). Flint's Amazon trope reflected a thread of 1896 news stories about Amazons and other women in Cuba that enjoyed a moment of popularity and was designed to redirect flagging US readers' attention to the war.<label for="sn-52" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-52" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>On the presence of Amazons, see: "Crushing Defeat of Spain's Army," _New York Herald_, April 17, 1896; "Maceo Seizes a Cuban Town," _New York Herald_, September 26, 1896; "Women in Cuba's Army: Amazons Who Fight with Valor in Freedom's Cause," _Washington Post_, March 8, 1896; "Maceo again Routed," _Washington Post_, February 10, 1896; "General Weyler's Plans," _Washington Post_, February15, 1896; "Brave Women and Young Girls Fighting in the Cuban Army," _New York Journal_, April 5, 1896; "Pretty Girls in the Cuban Army," _New York Journal_, October 10, 1896. Women were also a recurrent clickbait in news stories about the war before 1898. See, for instance: "Weyler Wars on Women," _New York Journal_, January 13_,_ 1897; "Weyler Throws Nuns into Prison. Butcher Wages Brutal Warfare on Helpless Women. Treats Them like Men," _New York Journal_, January 17, 1897.</span>

On the one hand, Flint was one of several widely read journalists to address reports of women who followed troops and fought alongside men, a view that contrasted with other news stories aimed at raising sympathy for helpless women being mistreated in the field. On the other hand, Flint’s assignment in Cuba did not have the level of success that his boss, William Randolph Hearst, expected. Flint’s news stories were not received regularly enough in New York to maintain reader engagement and suspense, and, in addition, his reports about the insurgents lacked the colorful exoticism expected by the _New York Journal_.<label for="sn-53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-53" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Milton, _Yellow Kids_, 91.</span> One likely possibility, then, is that Hearst’s editors evoked the Amazon trope to sell Flint’s narrative, as for example, in the New York Journal front-page layout of the Sunday, May 24, 1896 edition.

This possibility was considered by his fellow war correspondent Rea, who noted without further explanation in his book that the Amazon trope was imposed on Flint's work<label for="sn-54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-54" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Rea, _Facts and Fakes_, 137-138; McClintock, _Imperial Leather_, 26.</span> Rea's text provided a telling contrast to Flint's and helps explain how gendered narratives of Amazon women and the narrative of the uncivilized Cuban insurgent served similar purposes.

However, the topic modeling reveals other themes that go beyond an assessment of the information being published about Cuba, and, in those, the words "Gómez," "Spaniards," "Cuban," "Maceo," and "fight" are featured at the top of the most common topics. Rea focused on telling the insider story of an insurgent leader widely published in the US media, a story whose main culprit is a leader he vilifies as being "Black" and driven by emotion:

<blockquote>At last I would have the exceptional privilege of seeing and conversing with this somewhat mysterious personage so much talked about and so seldom visible… So this is Gómez! All my preconceived ideas of the man were shattered by a glance, for instead of the martial-looking old gentleman, whose bearing conveyed the idea of a thorough soldier, I found a chocolate-colored, withered old man, who gave one the idea of a resurrected Egyptian mummy, with the face lighted up by a pair of blurry, cold, expressionless gray eyes, that at times glowed like two red coals of fire, especially when in rage or passion.<label for="sn-56" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-56" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Rea, _Facts and Fakes_, 236.</span></blockquote>

Rea was determined to tell a "truth" that not even General Gómez wanted made known: that the real tactics of the "renowned" leader were "…nothing more or less than a game of hide-and-seek in the forests" to avoid direct fighting; that "heavy skirmishes… have been misnamed battles"; that their machetes were ineffective as weapons, that Gómez held Americans in contempt, and that Gómez's aides would lie rather than attempt to contradict him.<label for="sn-57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-57" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Rea, _Facts and Fakes_, xvii and xiii.</span> A more granular exploration using AntConc revealed that when Rea wrote about Gómez, he stressed the general's personality traits—his "vile temper," his being a fibber, his tantrums, authoritarian ways, unruliness, cruelty, violence—all of which aligned with his declared lack of respect for the Cuban leader. All these attributes positioned Gómez as a person easily overtaken by emotional rages, rather than a civilized, rational man: "There was fire in the old man's eyes…a storm was brewing."<label for="sn-58" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-58" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>Rea, _Fact and Fakes_, 278.</span> The book dealt some with the "fakes" of news reporting, but especially with "facts" that scorned and discredited Gómez. ~~was promoting, thereby disqualifying the general as a civilized leader capable of ruling a country.

By making Gómez a backward, cruel barbarian with a lack of emotional control, Rea reinforced a favorable image of the Spanish government and an unfavorable image of the Cuban revolutionaries. In fact, as a unique source of validation and redemption for Spain, a shortened version of Rea's book was published in Spanish in 1898 as _La verdad sobre la guerra. Revelaciones de un periodista yankee_ (_The Truth about the War: Revelations of a Yankee Journalist_), an abridged version that omitted controversial passages about the Spanish government and military.

In contrast to Flint, Rea stressed the wide array of weapons held by the insurgents. However, his descriptions emphasized lazy and indolent soldiers, many carrying a machete and, if not, serviceable rifles, "revolvers and shot-guns of every conceivable make and pattern," and blunderbusses. Rea's narrative explicitly interchanged the words "sword" and "machete": "the 'machete' is the sword of the Cuban soldiers," "sword in hand and the sword is the dreadful machete."<label for="sn-59" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-59" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 59 CONTENTS</span> Yet all weapons, whether modern or old-fashioned, were understood to be useless due to the insurgents' lack of bravery—they were portrayed as insistently preferring to dodge direct confrontation with the enemy, as indicated by the context in which Rea used the word "fight."

After discussing what Rea calls the "legends of the machete," he, like Flint, connected machetes to the presence of Amazons in the Cuban forces:

At first no one believed, who had not seen them, that there were women in the Cuban army; but there is no doubt about it. They are not at all miscalled Amazons, for they are war-like women, and do not shun fighting, the difficulty in employing them being that they are insanely brave. When they ride into battle, they become exalted, and are dangerous creatures.<label for="sn-60" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-60" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 60 CONTENTS</span>

CHECK_FOR_IMAGE

By comparison, the topic modelling of Scovel's articles reflects a disjointed text with little overlap in its topics (note how few of the topic bubbles overlap when compared to those depicting Flint's articles).

_Figure 8: http://kalanicraig.com/AHRDiachronicConversation/Viz/Scovel\_10Output.html_

While we expected this might be the case—Scovel's work on Gómez was largely communicated via news stories rather than in a book like Flint's or Rea's—we nonetheless chose to proceed for one key reason: Scovel's close relationship with General Gómez gave us the opportunity to explore his topical overlaps with those of Flint and Rea. Scovel's corpora consisted of 102 news articles, 89 of which were published in 1898. References to Cuba (e.g., "Cuba" or "Cubans") appear at or near the top of most of Scovel's topics and are far more frequent than the name "Gómez," which is featured in only a few topics. The frequency of the occurrence of the word "Cuba" muddied our interpretation of Cuba's importance along different topical lines, so we turned to dispersion measurement in AntConc of the word "Cubans," seeking out Scovel's version of the people of Cuba rather than of the land itself. We found that "Cubans" was especially important in pre-1898 articles. Of 13 pre-1898 articles in the dispersion measurement higher than 0, there were 9 or 32% mentions of "Cubans" in them, whereas in 1898, 20 or 22% of the 89 articles included that word. "Gómez," interestingly, was more often mentioned in pre-1898 articles (8 hits out of 13 Scovel articles, or 61%) compared to 10 mentions out of 89 news stories, or 11%. In other words, the AntConc dispersion measurement provided time-based changes that topic modeling does not offer. It showed that the nouns "Cubans," as well as "Gomez" were important in Scovel's news stories before January of 1898, but after the US government got directly involved in the war after the sinking of the _USS Maine_, Scovel turned his attention elsewhere. Cubans and Gómez disappeared from the pages of the New York World, having successfully served as Scovel's goads to garner the support of the US public in favor of US government action in Cuba. _FOOTNOTE 63 (move all the others forward one): Pinkerton agents documented the efforts by news correspondents like Scovel to goad President McKinley into action. See Díaz, “Spying on Cubans.”_

Tellingly, in Scovel's articles from 1896 to early 1898, Cuban people were represented as lazy, and insurgents as consistently cowardly: "Dodging tactics of the Cubans: the Cuban policy is not to fight. They are winning this war by running away." "The Cubans have always lived high without really working; the revolutionists have gained less in military organization, discipline, and drill than in any other important respect...they are mostly unorganized…" "…These men count for nothing as soldiers."<label for="sn-63" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-63" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 63 CONTENTS</span> The machete, the "sword-knife," was especially handy "if the father [didn't] like to work hard" for he could effortlessly cut a bunch of bananas to feed the family and, even if the insurgents were "not naturally brave," their skill with the machete allowed them to scare Spanish officers. Women were capable of using modern sewing machines while men used ancient plows for agriculture, yet women smoked a lot, as did their own children (a scandalous image for the American reader). In Scovel's texts, Cubans were consistently depicted as backward, savage, and incapable; men were pitiful while women were the only figures with some potentially positive civilized attributes.

As if to stress their "veracity," Scovel's representations of his dear friend, General Gómez, were framed within the context of one-on-one interviews in the interior of Cuba. For example, in his interview of December 23, 1897, which informed a piece of writing that ends by suggesting that the armed conflict would end up as a war between Spain and the United States, Scovel presented Gómez, one of the highest-ranking generals of the Cuban insurgency, as seated "in his hammock as usual." Scovel went on to prime the audience to see Gómez as someone closer to nature than to reason, with his description of Gómez's emotional state and body language: "the fiery old General's eyes blazed." Furthermore, the content of the article attached to the figure of Gómez some policies that would raise the brows of readers from "civilized" North America: the [barbaric] policy of hanging bribers, and the [unprogressive] prohibition of the grinding of sugar. These personal descriptions of Gómez frame the last full column of the piece, whose implied subtext was that the indolent Cuban insurgency was incapable of winning on its own merits without the "help" of the United States.

### Step 4: Revising The Boundaries of Our Sources 

At this point in our analysis, we wondered whether our newly framed understanding of these latent patterns would have been accessible to 19th-century readers outside the reach of US imperial narratives, or if they too would have been surprised by these subtexts.<label for="sn-64" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-64" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 64 CONTENTS</span> While focusing on US war correspondents' representations of the Cuban war helped us rethink Máximo Gómez and his chief-of-staff, General Bernabé Boza, offered a corrective to the "danger of one-way thinking" that Paul Kramer cautions against, and also highlight the value of using MMATCH in collaborative digital humanities projects.

Boza

Rather than treating the topic modeling as a standalone data set that could not be modified to provide strictly reproducible computational linguistics results, we focused on a systematic version of what Jo Guldi calls the "ambling, iterative course of exploration" that constitutes history evidence gathering.
<label for="sn-65" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-65" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 65 CONTENTS</span>
The nuances in meaning and pattern that Gómez's and Boza's Spanish-language diaries contributed to our then-English-only corpus were directly inspired by the results-and-revision feedback loop in MMATCH Step 4, which not only enriched our analyses but helped keep us accountable and grounded in both historiography and primary-source analysis. The multilingual approach proved to be an additional challenge we had not initially considered, but because we had already treated the English sources whether lumped together as a corpus or considered as individual entities, agreed to use the same approach, assessing Boza and Gómez together to provide a Cuban perspective and then separately to explore the latent patterns in each Spanish source.

General Gómez's diary topic modeling provided some surprises. Even though both Gómez and Boza were narrating their day-to-day experience of war in the interior of Cuba, Gómez's narrative stressed first-person pronouns and possessives in Spanish—_yo, mi, me_—in every single topic, signaling the importance he placed on his own role in driving the war forward. War, too, was emblematic of the repetitive topics on which Gómez focused. From marches and enemies to war and encampment, he was acutely aware of his positionality as a future father of the Cuban homeland and, therefore, the need he felt to memorialize his actions as a leader. This subtext in Gómez's diary is hinted at in the idealistic ways he wrote about Cuba, as both a place and a people who fought for freedom with great pain, sadness, heroism, and sacrifice. These expressions were enunciated at key moments, for instance, in 1892, when the Cuban Revolutionary Party was founded by José Martí in New York, and in August of 1898, when the war ended.<label for="sn-66" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-66" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 66 CONTENTS</span> The sentiment of sacrifice and heroism also permeated his narrative, especially when he addressed executing traitors, waging a war with few resources, and fighting selflessly on behalf of Cubans.

This contrasted with the diary of Bernabé Boza, itself different from Rea's portrayal of a laid-back insurgent army, and much in keeping with Flint's militarized presentation of Gómez's army. Boza's language centered on military hierarchy and government: army, war, government, operations, council, orders, coronel, barracks, military, encampment, while Boza's account left no doubt about the existence of an organized Cuban Republic government with a hierarchical line of command, a view that is difficult to grasp from Gómez, Rea, and even Scovel.

Furthermore, and contrary to the three American journalists' accounts, women were barely mentioned in either Boza's or Gómez's texts. Women made it into the two Cuban diaries as examples of Spain's inhumanity in indiscriminately killing women and children, or as companions to men, but rarely in their own right. The machete, on the other hand, was ever present in both Cubans' accounts. The machete was a tool intrinsic to life in Cuba's wild interior, a weapon key to their fight, and a symbol in their war cry "_¡al machete!_" And while Flint, Rea, and Scovel mentioned those aspects of the machete, they also embedded other semantic meanings that re-inscribed the insurrectionists' weapon of war as unimportant, barbaric, backward, and savage: a weapon of "little men," themselves of little significance to the Western "civilized" world.

Boza's diary was rich in details about the daily happenings in General Gómez's camp, including the visits of foreign war correspondents. He described Flint as _el inteligente Yankee_ (the smart Yankee)whose work, "although it contain[ed] some lies and misjudgments as is common in any work," was "the most impartial and exact [of the work by] war correspondents in the Cuban countryside."<label for="sn-67" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-67" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 67 CONTENTS</span> Boza described Flint and Scovel as "honest journalists" to whom "Cuba will always be thankful for the justice with which they treated the independence cause."<label for="sn-68" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-68" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 68 CONTENTS</span> By contrast, he went on to describe Rea's work as dishonest, a criticism likely grounded in that journalist's unapologetic attitude towards Gómez, though many of Rea's observations about insurgent weaponry and lack of ammunition and resources, as well as about fake reporting by American sources, may hold true today when Rea's account is compared to other primary sources, including General Gómez's diary.

Boza's read on Rea as a yellow journalist, and his acceptance of Flint and Scovel as mostly straightforward, exposes the value of topic modeling—and the barriers to understanding the latent and hidden nature of historical agents outside of imperial expansionist narratives. The coded allusions to tropes of the Western world in the work of both Flint and Scovel escaped Boza's and Gómez's attention. To wit, Gómez, we are told by Flint, held an "old-fashioned theory of the moral responsibility of journalism. He did not realize that successful newspapers arstruck off nowadays…with no other moral purpose in view than an extensive sale."<label for="sn-69" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-69" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 69 CONTENTS</span> As premised at the beginning of this article, then, we can see that, in their interpretation of the war in Cuba for the US readership to engage with and buy into, these three agents of transcultural translation employed tropes that, as Peter Hulme would argue, spoke covertly to a US audience's collective identity and aroused their sense of superiority. It was by these means that they "struck the blow" to the Cuban insurgents.

### Step 5: Results

Wrapping a topic-modeling analysis into our MMATCH structure offered several fruitful insights into the US imperialist mindset that framed the Third Cuban War of Independence for the American public. In our introduction, we started by asking not whether expansionist narratives have hidden content, but rather what those latent,elusive norms in US narratives about the Third Cuban War of Independence were. The lacuna in Boza's view of Scovel and Flint brings our analysis full circle. The meanings of Flint's, Scovel's, and even Rea's representations of the insurgents were as invisible to Boza as they were to us. US readers engaging with Boza's words would have been awash in coded tropes imperceptible to Boza himself, which in turn further reified for these audiences the poles of imperial-US "good" and Cuban-insurgent "bad" that Flint, Rea, and Scovel had crafted. Even had Boza been able to break out of the thematic frameworks that US journalists used, Flint, Scovel, and Rea—not Boza—were the primary path through which Cuban insurgents were made visible to US audiences. The repertoire of otherizing representations that the MMATCH process brought to the surface helped us see not just the language of a gendered insurgency as feminized "masses" of "lesser value", but also helped us see the difficulty contemporary Cubans had in shaping public views of their own in a landscape of language that was not their own.<label for="sn-70" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-70" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 70 CONTENTS</span>

Topic modeling made visible the latent connection between emasculation and sensationalism as we fully explored the narrative foundation of the she/her topic. The MMATCH approach that allowed us to negotiate the analysis drawn from topic models, corpus linguistics, and our close-reading helped us to better understand the causal link between the work of the war correspondents and the work of the war itself. The MMATCH process flagged topics that steered us to a subtext embedded in news stories and books targeted to an American readership that many Cubans in the island would have had a hard time recognizing.<label for="sn-71" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-71" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 71 CONTENTS</span> We would have seen some of the Amazonian language separately in a close read—as other authors have—but the links between women, machetes, and "little" men and the text's expansionist thread would likely have gone unnoticed.<label for="sn-72" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-72" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote" markdown=1>FOOTNOTE 72 CONTENTS</span>

Just as important, we would have missed the parallels that position Cuban and US writers as drawing on the same set of language patterns, but with dramatically different motivations and understandings of that imperialist language. On the one side of that leadership coin is Rea's depiction of the Cuban insurgency: impulsive rebels driven by emotion rather than logic, armed yet indolent, incapable, and ill-governed by leaders who, like the hysterical Amazons driven onto the field of battle by insurgent passion , had little control over their own emotions. On the other side is revolutionary zeal: Gómez's positioning of his own personal insurgency could be considered an avatar for Cuba, an alternative interpretation to Rea's overly emotional general. Both Rea's depiction of Gomez and Gomez' autobiography draw on emotion as a path to revolution, but the function of emotion for Gomez's own writing was designed to demonstrate care for the cause, while Rea referenced that very strong emotion as evidence that the insurgency would be unable to govern itself wisely.

Counternarratives on both sides also aligned as we connected the outcomes from our digital analysis to our close-reading analysis: there are unmistakable links between the versions of Cuban insurgency Flint and Boza presented. While Flint's less sensationalized narrative wasn't palatable enough for a US press that needed a helpless-nation-in-need story to sell about Cuba, his fixation on quotidian military hierarchy to demonstrate Cuba's organizational readiness matched that of his counterpart Boza. Both men sought to represent the broader movement of Cuban insurgents on the ground in a rapidly changing Caribbean.

Ultimately, Scovel, Flint, and Rea rendered Cuba as an empty female vessel waiting to be filled by the masculine presence of imperial forces, and Gómez himself was an avatar of the uncivilized and unfit nature of Cuba to become a nation. Even if the narratives of the three war correspondents were expressed differently, they were all ideologically threaded by the same strand. When repeated in the many other publications of the late 19thcentury, these othering narratives would covertly have justified the imperial ethos and fed a shared imagined sense of collective belonging among European Americans. At the height of 1896, the repercussions of such depictions of insurgent soldiers might have been imperceptible, yet they raised fledgling doubts of the capacity of Cubans for self-government that would mature in the second half of 1898. This process of priming the American public on what to think about Cuba and its people, and on the justification for overseas expansionism, started well before 1898. It stresses what Paul Kramer refers to as the imperial dimension of power—in this case, the scalar power exercised in the cultural realm of printed media that enabled and produced discursive relations of hierarchy. There is no doubt of the amplification of imperial power by the work of these journalists, as their writings enjoyed massive circulation. This is manifest from the effects these news had by 1898: the mostly unquestioned acceptance by the American public that US intervention in the war between Spain and Cuba was necessary, that this was a war between the United States and Spain, and that Cubans were not ready to rule their own country.

These imperialist narratives manufactured reality for their audiences, but also for the first two authors of this article in particular. As multicultural and multilingual women with family histories shaped by US imperial expansion to territories all around the globe, our positionality falls within the norm of US expansion. Yet, still, our experiences with modern US imperialist expansion did not afford us access to the dominant US imperialist narrative of the late 1890s. As with Boza, those encrypted tropes were opaque to us until our computational approaches helped us navigate the latent language that shaped the gendering of Cuba and its soldiers as women, and therefore weak, and either diminished its people as too savage for self-governance or disappeared them outright.

<section id="Conclusion" markdown=1>
## From the End of our MMATCH Project to the Beginning of Yours

What, then, are the stakes for MMATCH as a model for other historians? We see three scenarios are particularly relevant for AHR readers:

1. historians seeking to recognize labor and intellectual contributions in monographs and articles;
2. solo or collaborative authors moving between method and historical narrative as they introduce new methods into historical practice;
3. authors who could use MMATCH as an organizing principle for collaborative history projects in which they need to express separate analytical outcomes rooted in multiple positionalities but also present joint, integrated results.

In each of these scenarios, transparency would be the motivating factor for considering MMATCH as a potential approach. Transparency of methods is a vital part of the development of the historical discipline. Transparency allows historians to communicate our disciplinary practices effectively to the public, so that our arguments can be traced to their basis in concrete, clearly justified methodical approaches to the analysis of primary sources. Transparency of methods also allows us to train the next generation of historians, both explicitly and implicitly: undergraduates can learn more about the practice of history from MMATCH-enabled research, but they can also use it as a method to drive their own research.

For us, MMATCH has also been a lesson in enhanced transparency not of method but of the contents of our primary sources. When Arlene started her project on the role of secret-information gathering and its role in the imperial propaganda machinery of Spain and the United States, she was challenged by the nationalistic narrative of US empire that pervaded existing historiography on the Third War of Cuban Independence. Using those same US sources, but with new methods and a transparent documentation of those new methods, allowed us to challenge the pervasive nationalistic narrative of the war, and then move beyond the latent patterns in US propaganda. This in turn allowed us access to a different kind of evidentiary encounter with varied narratives of the war that include Cuban and Spanish perspectives; it also allowed us to make those encounters visible to other historians, who can in turn engage more readily with our findings and our process. What we learned far exceeded our expectations. It deepened our understanding of the Third Cuban War of Independence, but it also rendered our different approaches to the practice of history more transparent to the other members of our authoring team, made latent patterns visible, and made the sum of our collaborative historical practices greater than our individual, separate work.

[33](#sdfootnote33anc) We chose to divide our texts into human-readable sections, rather than equally sized "chunks" of 250 or 500 words. While the distributional model of topics will be more defensible in terms of its statistical validity, we aren't depending on the topic model as a result in itself but as a primary source of its own which can be used alongside the original text, to guide our interpretation.

[34](#sdfootnote34anc)A number of scholarly works support the critical and/or hermeneutic treatment of digital-methods results, rather than reducing the model to the statistical significance of words co-occurring in a topic.

Gordon and Susan Dumais, "Using Latent Semantic Indexing for Literature Based Discovery," _Journal of the American Society for Information Science_ 49, no. 8 (1998): 674–685; Blei, _et.al_., "Latent Dirichlet Allocation." Repeatable point-and-click versions of code in "notebooks" (we considered both Google Colab Notebooks and Jupyter Notebook) are a common, easily accessible way to tackle computational analysis. Recent changes to several of the dependencies (or software-installation requirements) that broke our go-to topic modeler's notebook-based interface with the GenSim visualization tool made us acutely aware of the need to provide a responsible, structured, but also easy-to-use approach to computational modeling. For the original GenSim topic model notebook, visit [https://colab.research.google.com/github/littlecolumns/ds4j-notebooks/blob/master/text-analysis/notebooks/Topic%20models%20with%20Gensim.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/littlecolumns/ds4j-notebooks/blob/master/text-analysis/notebooks/Topic%20models%20with%20Gensim.ipynb) .

[36](#sdfootnote36anc)We used coherence models to accommodate the "less precise" nature of our approach to topic models. A coherence model offers a measurable way to determine how many topics a historian should request from a topic model run on a specific corpus to produce topics that are sufficiently divergent from each other. If a word appears many times, it can be distributed to many topics if it appears clustered with a broad variety of other words. If the same words and word clusters appear in many of the topics in a topic model, making it difficult for a human reader to quickly differentiate between the contents of each topic. A coherence model, run first on all of the authors together and then individually for each author's work, suggested that our all-correspondent corpus would benefit from between 15 and 20 topics and our individual-correspondent corpora could support 7 to 10 topics.

Available from [https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html.); Digital historians have variously used corpus-linguistiics techniques to explore the details of their corpora, including Michelle Moravec, "'Under this name she is fitly described': A Digital History of Gender" _History of Woman Suffrage, Women and Social Movements_ (19, 1, March 2015).

[38](#sdfootnote38anc) To generate this screen capture of AntConc, we loaded the entirety of our English-language corpus (Rea, Scovel, and Flint), and then used the co-occurrence tab to search for words that co-occur 5 within 5 words ??? of "she" (before or after).

[39](#sdfootnote39anc) Based on keyword-in-context analysis (KWIC tab in AntConc), where we search for a word and get search returns of the full sentences surrounding that keyword, Scovel mostly uses "she" for the Maine, in about 20% of his mentions. The remainder of Scovel's uses of "she" refer to Spain or Cuba, then to Clara Barton, and then to other ships. For the other two US sources, Spain, Cuba, and women in the war were far more common than "she" references to ships.

[46](#sdfootnote46anc) In contrast to what Flint says, the machetes used by insurgent leaders were "long, heavy and single-edged." General Máximo Gómez's machete, for example, measured 33.8 inches, while the one that Antonio Maceo wielded when he died was 28.7 inches.[https://www.thecubanhistory.com/2019/03/el-machete-terrible-weapon-of-war-of-the-cubans-photos/](https://www.thecubanhistory.com/2019/03/el-machete-terrible-weapon-of-war-of-the-cubans-photos/) This contrasted with the machetes used by enslaved people to cut cane—the '_mocho_'—which were much shorter, worn-out, tipless, and usually made from broken pieces of a longer machete. Using a mocho required enslaved workers to bend down to get closer to the roots of the sugarcane stem and, if used as a weapon, to be physically closer to an enemy to defend themselves.
