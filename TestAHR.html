  <h2 id="the-historiographic-stakes-of-late-19th-century-caribbean-history">The historiographic stakes of late 19th-century Caribbean history</h2>

  <p>At first glance, US historiography on the Spanish-Cuban-American War (1895-1898) may seem extensive. However, most of what has been written privileged the US perspective on the war, mostly focused on the moment when the United States militarily intervened in the ongoing armed conflict between Spain and Cuba, and justified their actions as a fulfillment of their moral duty to help Cubans gain their independence.[1]</p>

  <p>However, an in-depth analysis of sources from the three countries reveal that the United States government knew that they lacked casus belli to intervene in war. From 1895 to 1897, presidents Cleveland and McKinley inaction safeguarded the interests of US property owners and commercial interests in and with Cuba as they worried about retaliation from Spain. They preferred to impel Spain to reform its relationship with the island rather than have a fully independent Cuba ruled by “uncivilized” multiracial insurgents that they, a “racially superior” and “civilized” US government officials and business community, did not want to deal with. Cuban insurgents in the island, many of whom participated in Cuba’s first war of independence (1868-1878), would not accept anything less than full independence. Meanwhile, white, wealthy Cuban émigrés in the United States who feared losing their racial and economic privileges, also desired a change in Cuba’s relationship with Spain and were uneasy about the possibilities of the raceless nation project of the insurgents. But when Cuban insurgents unequivocally repudiated Spain’s offer of autonomy in December of 1897, wealthy New York Cuban émigré leaders who had kept a low profile up to that moment, took control of the ruling New York Cuban Junta that directed the war in the island from abroad. The wealthy Cuban leaders demanded that mostly reluctant insurgents in the island cooperate with the US military especially after the (internal) explosion of the USS Maine in the Bay of Havana was blamed on Spain and used as a justification for US involvement in the war. The changing circumstances, the heightened media frenzy to get the US president to finally do something about Cuba, island insurgents’ repudiation of US call for a cease fire, US Congress joint resolution to respect Cuban independence with some caveats, all paved the way for United States’ swift military landing and victory in the island in the summer of 1898 and eventual neocolonial relationship with Cuba in the twentieth century.</p>

  <p>Many US historians working on this war focused on a portion of what had been a much longer conflict between Cuba and Spain that started in 1868. Encapsulating the event to 1898 not only iterates the claim that the United States became imperial by accident –provoked by the sinking of the USS Maine–and that, consequently, the country had to suddenly “learn” to become an empire after 1898.[2] In addition, such historiographical focus contributed to the labeling of the event as the “Spanish-American War” which erases Cubans as the protagonists in their own wars of independence.<label for="sidenote-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

  <h2 id="how-do-we-build-empire-and-histories-of-empire">How do we build empire (and histories of empire)?</h2>

  <p>How does an empire make its actions meaningful to its subjects/people/citizens? How do those values weave themselves into everyday life and in the one-on-one on-the ground interactions between imperial agents and local inhabitants? These questions have informed scholars concerned with the cultural workings of imperialism as it has become clear that language, representation and the meanings they encrypt are key cogs in the empire-building machinery.[5] The use of coded hierarchical discourses in texts and visual representations play a role in justifying and naturalizing domination and, as such, informs and prepares audiences to support actions that legitimize the power of ruling or aspiring political elites or groups. Formal empires may be disappearing as political entities, but the use of operations of discourse that encrypts unequal power relationships, that justifies and normalizes dominion and the silencing of others who the narrative dismisses as powerless and of lesser importance to a purportedly superior civilization continues to this day. Yet, how can the meaning-making powers of the empire be rendered visible to the researcher when much of those coded meanings have been normalized and taken for granted? This essay tackles these issues in two parts.[6] First, we will address the historical problems informing this study through an example of US war correspondents who interviewed and produced texts on a Cuban insurgent general during the Spanish-Cuban-American war; the second part addresses how the use of computational linguistic tools facilitated the identification of key topics within the contexts of the words that surrounded them in a piece of writing, which allowed us to interpret their meanings based on both its digital outputs and historical context.</p>

  <h2 id="representation-war-correspondents-and-empire-making">Representation, War Correspondents and Empire-Making</h2>

  <p>Paving the way for US expansionism in the nineteenth century were mass-produced consumer spectacles, dime-novels, newspapers, museums and special events geared towards European-Americans. US entrepreneurs saw much commercial potential in the white, English-speaking, Christian-protestant audiences who they catered entertainment that allowed them to imagine themselves as a homogeneous “American” imagined community. Spectacles like Bill Cody’s “Buffalo Bill Wild West” presented the frontier as a mythic place and its history became one where fiction and reality coexisted. For the audience, the stories of the US frontier cowboy wars against Native Americans, and the fact that Cody had participated in those wars himself as well, made those stories be recognized as authentic while making palatable “the principle that violence and savage war were the necessary instruments of American progress” and “that the bullet is the pioneer of civilization.” Indeed, the frontier narrative trope/formula became an ideological archetype and precedent for the expansionist struggle against “savages” and “regressive races” by progressive imperialists such as Theodore Roosevelt. Similarly, other traveling spectacles such as P.T. Barnum freak show, commodified European-American fascination with “curiosities” meaning the display of people with physical deformities, many of whom were Black or mixed-race, as primitives and animal-like which reaffirmed already-existing association between non-Western people and their non-human status. The 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, further built up on those ideas while showcasing “inferior others” and their alleged incapability of enacting “progress” which cemented a sense of European-American “superior” status as technological innovators, and their ability to tame “nature” (meaning the land and the native people in it) to bring a land of abundance. Such mass-produced consumer spectacles, along with many other cultural manifestations of the time, became powerful vehicles through which stereotypes about other cultures and expansionism were adapted, generated, propagated and iterated.</p>

  <p>Indeed, what was published and performed in shows at the time gave European-American audiences “a sense of ownership, entitlement and familiarity with respect to the distant parts of the world that were being explored, invaded, invested in, and colonized.” What was represented in many nineteenth-century publications, performances and exhibitions, helped justify expansionism and, most importantly, legitimize and make European-Americans “feel part of a planetary project.” In other words, cultural manifestations served, purposely or not, knowingly or unknowingly, to develop, debate and spread ideas that would give meaning to their representations. Terms that describe “others,”; tropes, metaphors, and euphemisms that would covertly justify domination over other lands and its inhabitants were developed and established through the circulation of representations via cultural manifestations. Those terms circulated because they became common currency; people would intuitively repeat them because the use of that language implied belonging to a superior community, all which helped structure a collective unconscious. People living in the midst of these cultural iterations become, intentionally or not, participants of the expansionist project when in their repetition of terms and representations they contribute to normalize a hierarchical and expansionist point of view.[8]</p>

  <p>Expeditionaries, travelers, reporters, scholars have all been important historical agents of expansionism. Among all those, journalists–and we would add scholars–have been singled out for being “perhaps the most open, in that their raison d’ȇtre is to write, and so they leave records of their interpretations.”[9] But more than that, journalists, especially nineteenth-century war correspondents, had the major task of constantly translating and making a foreign place and people comprehensible to an audience thirsty to know about the world outside the US mainland. They became, as Peter Hulme would have it, “agents of transculturation,” because “they passed as interpreters of Cuban culture to a US readership.”  Some agents of transculturation would, embedded with the authority they automatically acquire as a first-hand observer, undermine and sabotage the foreign people they write about as “translation is often the means at hand to strike the blow.” For example, New York Herald reporter, George Eugene Bryson, translated an article Cuban intellectual José Martí wrote hours before being killed by the Spaniards on May 19, 1895 in Dos Ríos, Cuba. Luis Toledo Sande carefully compared what Martí wrote in Spanish and the translation Bryson published in English and found that only 63% of Martí’s text has a direct correspondence to what was published in English. The remaining 37% of the article that was silenced by the newspaper referred to Martí’s discussion of the maturity of the revolution, the national unity and democratic spirit of the insurgency, all of which were mentioned by the Cuban intellectual to preempt US arguments that they could be mediators and guarantors of peace in the conflict. In addition to cutting critical parts of the original text, others were distorted to make believe that Martí supported foreign exploitation of Cuba’s “hidden treasures.” (40). Finally, the word “revolution” was replaced by “revolt” to undermine the true nature of the war by Cuban insurgents.“</p>

  <h3 id="an-overview-of-mixed-method-approaches-to-collaborative-history-mmatch-as-a-solution-to-the-epistemological-challenges-of-digital-history">An overview of Mixed-Method Approaches To Collaborative History (MMATCH) as a solution to the epistemological challenges of digital history</h3>

  <div class="epigraph"><blockquote>At the beginning, I could not see the beauty of it. Initially this felt like it’s in the theoretical stratosphere. The practical reality is that I can see [<strong>in the different visualizations it provides</strong>] what I’m thinking about as a scholar grounded in the trends the data gives to me, but that the interpretive methods, and the data itself, need to be curated. <em>Arlene, in conversation</em></blockquote></div>

  <p>As with many histories, we’ve rooted our epistemology–how we “know” the history of the Cuban War of Independence–in the space between our own positionality, primary source close-reading, and the expertise contained in the historiographic body of secondary sources in which we situate ourselves as scholars of a particular subfield. The suspension of a scholar between personal interpretation, source material, and external scholarly traditions has a long-standing, if elitist, history. From the late-Antique paideia that marked a young man as part of the Greek-educated elite to the shared-world-view weltanschauung or bildung of the well-educated European, scholarly knowledge of the humanist bent is built on the hermeneutic ability of well-trained scholars with a common worldview and shared scholarly tradition. Incorporating digital methods, then, can seem like a disruptor in the worst of possible ways, a button we push that bypasses the individual scholar with analysis spit out by a computer and reproduced without question.</p>

  <p>Most digital-history scholarship acknowledges the role of these hermeneutic traditions; the most recent of that scholarship expands the idea of methods-driven history to include digital methods as one element of the hermeneutic itself, albeit one that requires a methods section. We take these approaches one step further by formalizing the importance to scholarly production of interpretive dialogue–of conversation, with ourselves, our sources, and our methods–that is often informal and thus invisible. MMATCH, or Mixed-Method Approaches To Collaborative History, eschews the formality, and accompanying exclusivity of, individual hermeneutics and the received, unquestioned knowledge of data. Instead, we acknowledge the roots of our scholarship in informal conversations with colleagues in hallways and around computer screens. By marking these conversational spaces as formal sites of authorship, MMATCH both surfaces the silences we accept as part of individual authorship and emphasizes the interpretive nature of interacting with digital tools in history.</p>

  <p>MMATCH is comprised of five stages, which we will first lay out in terms broad enough to suit most mixed-method collaborative authorship teams and then more narrowly for our specific focus on the Cuban War of Independence:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sourcing: initial agreement on the boundaries of the primary source base and individual needs for the study.</li>
    <li>Parallel interpretation: separate scholarly analysis that addresses the individual positionality and methods specialties of each person in the collaboration</li>
    <li>Dialogue-based triangulation: interstitial and informal historiographic conversation that triangulates the separate methods analyses. The outcome of this stage should be a draft analysis documented clearly, either in the methods section or labeled as “in-progress” analysis in the results section.</li>
    <li>Revised parallel/joint interpretation: a cyclical round of formal and informal conversation that includes individual interpretation and potential methods changes resulting from the conversation in step 3. Steps 3 and 4 may repeat several times and need not be separate, as with Step 2.</li>
    <li>Formal written results</li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are a number of related models that help position the MMATCH approach as building on, as well as new to, both humanities and social-science versions of the historical method. On the humanities side, which privileges the interpretation of an individual, several practices align with MMATCH. The first is Johanna Drucker’s idea of capta: data, Drucker says, is given to the researcher as a whole set of prefabricated stuff. Capta is taken, captured, from unstructured evidence and turned into structured information through humanistic interpretation. On the other side of the historian’s interaction with computational results is what Jo Guldi describes as “critical searching,” in which the individual historian uses in-text search in their own critical reading of search returns as a stand-in for a strand of literature focused on the critique of digital tools and their results. These interpretive moves privilege the individual expert, a vital position for the humanistic practice of history; at the same time, that individual interpretation can circumscribe collaborative efforts. MMATCH closes that gap by bringing the formal historiographic conversation and informal seminar discussion together in service of collaborative capta and critical interpretation of computational models.</p>

  <p><img src="/AHRDiachronicConversation//assets/img//CreswellTriangulation.png" alt="Creswell, triangulation" />
On the social science side, the need for repeatability and validation necessitates the articulation of well-documented mixed-methods approaches that blend quantitative and qualitative approaches to research. MMATCH might be most closely aligned with Triangulation Design, in which qualitative and quantitative data collection and methods are done separately, often with one prioritized over the other, and then triangulated to validate and extend the results from both methods. Triangulation Design as a model for digital-history collaborations stops short of the historical method in two ways. First, it generally assumes that data for quantitative and qualitative methods will be different and that one of the methods will take priority. Historians work holistically with primary- and secondary-source collections that can be prepared differently (capta) but which are ultimately the subject of interpretation in equal measure. Second, Triangulation assumes that the articulation of a method would result in repeatable empirical results. Repeatability is based on an assumption that directly challenges the idea that historical interpretation changes as the positionality of the author changes.</p>

  <p>MMATCH addresses both of these by documenting the value of informal discussions that often contribute meaningfully to the development of historical scholarship but are waved away as unciteable ‘conversations’ with minimal effect on authorship. MMATCH instead positions the conference-hallway conversation and conversations like it as the primary site of both capta collection and analysis. It also builds a collaborative positionality among the specific authors of a piece of historical analysis while still offering a repeatable process (even if the results aren’t necessarily empirically repeatable). The epistemological stakes of this approach, then, are threefold:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It offers an epistemologically sound solution to folks interested in a digital-methods approach to their research question but for whom the method is a serious barrier to entry.</li>
    <li>It models a fair, equitable research-collaboration practice for traditionally single-author disciplines by
      <ul>
        <li>extending the literature on individual interpretation and hermeneutics to a collaborative model based in existing historical-methods practices</li>
        <li>expanding access to the world of scholarly production to anyone with a voice in these informal scholarly conversations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It offers a model for discipline-wide development of a formal literature in historical methods, which values the development, articulation and presentation of new methods, the communication of those new methods to practitioners of a variety of interest in those new methods, and the centrality of collaborative hermeneutics.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By interpolating our conversations and computational text analysis in MMATCH, we’re simultaneously offering an interpretive view of historical data but also changing our interpretive lens so that we can better understand our own present-day positionality as we explore the historical perspective. These choices acknowledge our individual centers of expertise and, in encouraging a collaborative process that makes the translational leap from computational model to close-read historical analysis, hit a middle ground between the structuralism of computational analysis and the hermeneutics of post-structuralism that shape the historiographic conversation and its contributors. We hope ultimately that MMATCH will make it easier to facilitate the training of interdisciplinary and interspecialty historians and provide a collaborative approach to the writing of methods-driven history.</p>

<section id="Step1">

  <h4 id="step-1-sourcing-periodization-and-corpus-building">Step 1: Sourcing, periodization and corpus building</h4>

  <p>With MMATCH established as a general process that suits mixed-methods history collaborations of many kinds, we now want to turn our attention to the specifics of MMATCH in a digital-history analysis of Cuba and its people as they are represented in late 1890s war correspondence. The three reporters who anchor this study are representatives of a much larger body of public-facing journalism during the Cuban War of Independence. These journalistic sources, comprise a small portion of the overwhelmingly large corpus of public and private documents, sometimes produced by these same public-facing journalists acting as spies, that shaped late-19th-century US foreign policy. Differentiating between the individual effects of each reporter and the broader weltanschauung of imperialist, expansionist language is made more difficult by the echoes of neutral, technocratic labels of good and bad still being applied in today’s US foreign policy.</p>

  <p>We thoroughly introduced our three authors–Flint, Gomez and Scovel–in our introduction, but we also identified some of the cultural aspects of imperialism that shape foreign policy. Our articulation of MMATCH helped us simultaneously identify our own positionality as subjects of US imperialist policy, produce a repeatable treatment of the expansionist language in the larger corpus, and address the weaknesses of unquestioned dependence on computational analysis as neutral and “accurate”. In other words, MMATCH offered a guided computational reading that helped us step back from the imperialist language in which we are enmeshed as US citizens and treat that same computational analysis as a source that can be interpreted alongside our primary sources. To do that, we needed both a computational-flyover view of our sources to expose the weltanschauung of imperialist language, and we needed to connect that flyover view to the act of close reading.</p>

</section>
<section id="Step2">

  <h4 id="step-2-parallel-computational-and-close-reading-analysis">Step 2: Parallel computational and close-reading analysis</h4>

  <p>For the zeitgeist flyover, we identified topic modeling as a way to understand how different words and concepts are distributed (equally and unequally) throughout the works of our three journalists, both individually and as a whole. Topic modeling looks at how words occur and co-occur with each other within the context of discrete "chunks" or sections in a larger corpus of text. We chose to use LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing), a less “precise” topic-modeling algorithm, for that distributional analysis for two MMATCH-related reasons. First, while there are algorithms that produce more “precise” topic models, our choice to use MMATCH as a hermeneutic approach meant we could treat our computational analysis as an interpretive layer applied to our primary sources and subject to conversation and revision, rather than as a static single-pass quantitative analysis. Second, to emphasize both the conversational nature of historiography and the need for other methods-driven collaborations to work with our method, LSI is simply easier for other researchers seeking to model their work on ours.<label for="LSI-Colab" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="LSI-Colab" class="margin-toggle sf-hidden">
<span class="sidenote">Repeatable point-and-click versions of code in “notebooks”--we considered both Google Colab Notebooks and Jupyter Notebooks–are a common, easily accessible way to tackle computational analysis. Recent changes to several of the dependencies (or software-installation requirements) for LDA makes it harder to run in these easy-to-use environments, and MMATCH rendered us acutely aware of the need to provide a responsible structured, but also easy to use, approach to computational modeling.</span></p>

  <p>We chose LSI as a slightly less precise, but still generative, computational analysis approach in Google Colab scaffolded by documented triangulation conversations so that other digital-history teams could reuse our specific MMATCH steps. OUR CODE IS HERE To responsibly address some of the clear methods drawbacks of LSI (vs LDA or TF-IDF [see Guldi, TF-IDF article]), we used coherence models first on all of the authors together and then individually for each author’s work. If topics contain too many similar word pairs, it will be hard for a person to figure out what the difference between topics is. A coherence model offers a measurable way to figure out which number of topics are the most divergent. We also established a need for visualization in our step-1 boundary-and-need conversation: Gensim offers a nice visualization of the word-cluster differences and overlaps between each of the topics, so that we could use both text and visualization to root our Step-3 conversations in.</p>

  <p>Our conversations in both Step 1 and Step 3 of MMATCH, as we negotiated the boundaries of the study and the first round of our individual results, also helped us identify a need for frequency and co-occurrence analysis–most commonly represented in word-clouds (frequency) and n-grams (co-occurrence)–which allowed us to quickly find and debate the original primary-source contexts of concepts and words in Step 3.</p>
